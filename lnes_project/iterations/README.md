## 🎯 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Understand Where You Are
Read **PROJECT_COMPLETION_ROADMAP.md** first. It provides:
- Current project status (70% complete)
- Gap analysis
- Recommended completion paths
- Effort estimates

### Step 2: Choose Your Goal
Pick one of three paths:

**Path A: Quick Finish** (12-16h)
- Iterations 1-4
- Goal: Presentable research project
- Output: GitHub showcase, course project

**Path B: Academic Publication** (25-32h)
- Iterations 1-7
- Goal: Conference/journal paper
- Output: Submittable research

**Path C: Research Platform** (40-50h)
- All 8 iterations
- Goal: State-of-the-art tool
- Output: Extensible platform

### Step 3: Start Implementation
When ready to begin:
```
"Implement Iteration 1"
```

To implement multiple iterations:
```
"Implement Iterations 1-3"
```

## 📊 Project Status

### Current State (as of analysis)
- ✅ **70% Complete** - Solid technical foundation

- ✅ Two datasets supported (small + FNSPID)
- ✅ Six agent types working
- ❌ Missing documentation, analysis, visualization
- ❌ No research paper structure
- ❌ Limited statistical validation

### After Iteration 1 → 75% Complete
- ✅ All documentation exists and links work
- ✅ Project is understandable

### After Iteration 3 → 85% Complete
- ✅ Reproducible research with notebooks
- ✅ Configuration management
- ✅ Research-grade metrics

### After Iteration 7 → 100% Complete
- ✅ Publication-ready research project
- ✅ All components finished
- ✅ Paper ready for submission

## 🗺️ Iteration Dependencies

```
Iteration 1 (Documentation)
    └─→ No dependencies (start here!)

Iteration 2 (Advanced Metrics)
    └─→ Optional: After Iteration 1 (for better docs)

Iteration 3 (Notebooks)
    └─→ Recommended: After Iteration 1, 2

Iteration 4 (Visualization)
    └─→ Recommended: After Iteration 2 (for plotting new metrics)

Iteration 5 (Testing)
    └─→ Can do anytime, benefits from Iterations 2, 4

Iteration 6 (Comparative Analysis)
    └─→ Requires: Iteration 2 (uses metrics)
    └─→ Optional: Iteration 5 (for testing comparisons)

Iteration 7 (Research Paper)
    └─→ Requires: Iterations 1-4 (needs results to document)
    └─→ Recommended: Iterations 5, 6 (for validation)

Iteration 8 (Extensions)
    └─→ Optional: Build on any/all previous iterations
```

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Before Starting Any Iteration
1. Read the full iteration file
2. Understand the goal and tasks
3. Check dependencies
4. Estimate if you have time

### During Implementation
- Follow the task order (designed for efficiency)
- Test incrementally
- Document as you go
- Ask for clarification if needed

### After Completing Iteration
- Run all tests
- Verify success criteria
- Update project status
- Celebrate the progress! 🎉
