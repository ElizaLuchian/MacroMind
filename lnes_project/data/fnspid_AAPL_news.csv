2023-01-04,Alcoa (NYSE:AA) stock has declined by close to 10% over the last month and remains down by close to ,"Alcoa (NYSE:AA) stock has declined by close to 10% over the last month and remains down by close to 24% over the past year. Now, the broader markets have taken a hit in recent weeks, amid concerns about a U.S. recession in 2023.  The Federal Reserve is also continuing with its hawkish stance with plans of further rate hikes, despite the moderating pace of inflation and this is likely to weigh on demand for industrial commodities. Aluminum prices have also declined from around $2,500 per ton in early December to about $2,400 currently and remain well below levels of over $3,000 per ton seen in early 2022. Moreover, aluminum output from China has also been expanding, driven by relaxed power restrictions and new capacity coming online. Over November 2022, China’s primary aluminum production was up by 9.4% year-over-year. While the impact of this on prices is likely to be partly alleviated by China’s move to raise tariffs on aluminum exports, this could be a negative for the aluminum market.
We remain neutral on Alcoa stock, with a $47 price estimate, which is roughly in line with the current market price. Although there could be near-term headwinds for commodities given the uncertain macro environment, we see a couple of positives for aluminum producers such as Alcoa. Energy prices have cooled off a bit in recent weeks, and this could help Alcoa to an extent. Moreover, rising investments in the renewable energy sector including electric vehicles, charging infrastructure, and solar & wind power plants remain secular drivers for aluminum demand. We also think that Alcoa has an edge over other aluminum producers in the longer run,  given its strong balance sheet (net debt of just about $370 million), and relatively greener operations with its smelting operations largely running on hydropower. See our analysis of Alcoa valuation for a closer look at what’s driving our price estimate for Alcoa and how Alcoa’s valuation compares with peers. Also see our analysis of Alcoa Revenue for more details on how Alcoa’s revenues are expected to trend.

2023-01-11,The market expects Alcoa (AA) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when,"The market expects Alcoa (AA) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.
The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 18, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.
While management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings callwill mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This bauxite, alumina and aluminum products company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.76 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -130.4%.
Revenues are expected to be $2.59 billion, down 22.4% from the year-ago quarter.
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 33.33% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.
Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Alcoa?
For Alcoa, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.
On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.
So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Alcoa will beat the consensus EPS estimate.
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?
While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.
For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Alcoa would post earnings of $0.09 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.33, delivering a surprise of -466.67%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.
That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.
Alcoa doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

Jan 11 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp's CVX.N Wheatstone domestic gas plant has re-commenced supply to the Western Australia market, a spokesperson for the oil and gas explorer's Australian unit said on Wednesday.
Gas supply to Western Australia had been cut due to an equipment failure that knocked out Chevron's 215 terajoules-a-day Wheatstone plant on Jan. 5.

Below are the earnings reports to watch for the week of January 16th:

New Oriental Education EDU is a stock that has illustrated Chinese market sentiment to perfection. In March of 2021, the stock neared $200 a share. Fast forward one year, and shares collapsed below $9 per share.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Pictured: EDU had a nasty 2022 but shares are on the mend.
The Chinese provider of language education and prep courses was adversely impacted by China’s slowing economy and stringent Covid 19 lockdown policy. Now, the Chinese government is once again unlocking their markets by lifting the lockdowns and providing stimulus to an ailing economy. Consensus analyst estimates suggest that as China’s economy normalizes, so will New Oriental Education’s earnings. If this is the case, the stock may just be starting its rebound.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Pictured: Estimate Revisions are rising for EDU and other Chinese stocks.
Interactive Brokers IBKR. A rising interest rate environment (like the one we’re in now) is often a headwind for most stocks. However, Interactive Brokers, a multi-asset class online broker that caters to sophisticated traders, is one exception. On its October 17thearnings call the company announced an earnings surprise. The catalyst? IBKR saw its revenue from margin loans to customers spike dramatically as rates rose.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Pictured: IBKR hopes to keep its earnings momentum up as interest rates rise.
Interactive Brokers has a healthy Expected EPS 3-5 Year Growth Rate of 22.47% and holds the best possible Zack’s #1 ranking, suggesting that last quarter’s results may not be a one-and-done. In an impressive show of relative price strength, the stock sits less than 5% off its all-time high while the major U.S. indexes remain well off their highs.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Pictured: IBKR and other stock brokers are outperforming the market in recent months.
Goldman Sachs GS and Morgan Stanley MS are leading investment management and banking companies. Like most stocks, banks performed poorly last year. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley hold mediocre Zack’s Rankings of 3. That said, a surprise to the upside may help these stocks turn around. Valuations are getting more attractive. For example, GS has a P/E ratio of just 9.52, which compares favorably to the S&P 500 Indexes 17.8.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Pictured: Banks like GS are starting to get attractive on a valuation basis. We will get more info next week when they report.
Another positive development in the sector is the technical picture. GS, MS, and JP Morgan JPM are all experiencing “golden crosses”. A golden cross occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average. Golden crosses favor bulls.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Pictured: GS 50-day has crossed over its 200-day moving average to signal a golden cross.
United Airlines UAL, the holding company for United Airlines and Continental Airlines, has been on a tear for the past two weeks. In the upcoming quarter, United is expected to post earnings of $2.09 per share up a strong 230% versus last year. More importantly, Zack’s Consensus Estimates have been on the rise and have changed by 27.4% over the past 30 days. Zacks Research suggests that rising consensus estimates is one of the key ingredients to finding winning stocks. UAL currently holds an overall Zacks Ranking of 2.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Pictured: UAL is estimated to have massive growth versus last year. The stock rose yesterday even as most domestic flights were cancelled.
Wednesday, airlines like Delta DAL and United rose even as a temporary grounding by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded all flights. Delta is set to report earnings Friday. With airlines like UAL up nearly 25% in the past two weeks into earnings, investors should be sizing up whether the risk-reward is worth it or if it is better to watch from the sidelines. Either way, the industry seems to be turning the corner.
Wednesday, January 18th
Charles Schwab SCHW is a securities brokerage, loan holding company, and asset management firm. Like its industry group peer Interactive Brokers, the stock has outperformed the general market, although it maintains a mid-tier Zack’s Ranking of 3.
Alcoa AA is the leading aluminum miner in the world. Earnings and revenues are set to slow for a second straight quarter as consensus EPS estimates for the quarter have been revised lower by 33.33% over the past 30 days. A key technical zone to watch will be the 200-day moving average. The stock is trying to clear the technical level for the first time since early 2022.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Pictured: Alcoa is trying to pop back above its 200-day moving average.
Thursday, January 19th
Netflix NFLX is the  streaming spaces pioneer and leader – boasting more than 220.67 million subscribers worldwide. Last year, even though the company beat earnings expectations, shares stumbled as subscriber growth expectations slowed. Shares of Netflix have stormed back since making lows last May. The stock recently triggered a golden cross.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Pictured: Netflix will be a big earnings report for tech. Last year shares weighed down the Nasdaq.
Proctor and Gamble PG is a massive consumer products company. PG is the perfect stock for those who want to avoid drama and sleep at night. The stock has a beta of just 0.42 and pays a healthy dividend of 2.41%.
American Airlines AAL will cap off earnings for the major airlines next week. AAL has seen strong buying in recent days. The stock has been up for eight straight days, of which six were on above-average volume. While it is never prudent to chase price moves, investors should keep their eye on the industry as a potential turnaround play in 2023.

2023-01-12,"Alcoa Corporation AA is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2022 results on Jan 18, after market clo","Alcoa Corporation AA is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2022 results on Jan 18, after market close.

The company has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters, while missing in one.

Let’s see how things are shaping up for Alcoa this earnings season.
Alcoa Price and EPS Surprise
Alcoa price-eps-surprise | Alcoa Quote
Factors to Note
Alcoa’s fourth-quarter performance is likely to have been hurt by lower shipments in Alumina due to reduced production rates at the San Ciprián refinery in Spain to combat high natural gas prices and lower volumes in Aluminum due to reduced trade in Europe amid ongoing geopolitical tensions among other factors. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales in the fourth quarter indicates a 22.4% decline from the year-ago reported figure.

High energy costs, primarily in Europe due to war tensions and raw material cost inflation, are expected to have dented Alcoa’s bottom line in the fourth quarter.

The Bauxite segment’s performance is likely to have suffered due to lower shipments as a result of decreased demand in the Atlantic bauxite market and lower demand from some Alumina segment refineries, among other factors. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the unit’s fourth-quarter sales (third-party sales + intersegment sales) hints at a 4.7% decrease from the year-ago reported number.

An anticipated reduction in shipments in the Alumina segment is expected to have weighed on total sales (third-party sales + intersegment sales). The consensus estimate for total Alumina sales in the fourth quarter suggests a 27.5% plunge from the year-ago reported number.

The Aluminum segment sales are likely to reflect the impact of lower shipments due to the partial curtailment of the Warrick smelter, among other factors and reduced trading activities. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales from the segment shows a 24.5% drop from the fourth quarter of 2021 reported figure.
What Does the Zacks Model Say?
Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Alcoa this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates, which is not the case here, as elaborated below. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Earnings ESP: Alcoa has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 76 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

Zacks Rank: Alcoa currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.
Highlights of Q3 Earnings
In the third quarter of 2022, Alcoa incurred a loss of 33 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 9 cents. In the year-ago period, the company had reported earnings of $2.05 per share. Total revenues of $2.85 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.33%. The top line declined 8.4% year over year.
Stocks to Consider
Here are some companies you may want to consider from the Zacks Industrial Products sector, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this season:

Caterpillar CAT has an Earnings ESP of +1.87% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to release fourth-quarter earnings numbers on Jan 31.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Caterpillar’s fourth-quarter earnings has been revised upward by 1% in the past 60 days. CAT pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 14.7%, on average.

IDEX Corporation IEX has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is slated to release fourth-quarter financial numbers on Jan 31.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for IDEX’s fourth-quarter earnings has been revised upward by a penny in the past 60 days. IEX delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 5.7%, on average.

Xylem XYL has an Earnings ESP of +1.27% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is set to release fourth-quarter results on Feb 7.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Xylem’s fourth-quarter earnings has remained steady in the past 60 days. XYL pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 13.3%, on average.

Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.
Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2023-01-18,Alcoa (AA) came out with a quarterly loss of $0,"Alcoa (AA) came out with a quarterly loss of $0.70 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.85. This compares to earnings of $2.50 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 17.65%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this bauxite, alumina and aluminum products company would post earnings of $0.09 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.33, delivering a surprise of -466.67%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.
Alcoa, which belongs to the Zacks Metal Products - Distribution industry, posted revenues of $2.66 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.67%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.34 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.
The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.
Alcoa shares have added about 20.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 3.9%.
What's Next for Alcoa?
While Alcoa has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?
There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.
Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Alcoa: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.18 on $2.81 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.66 on $11.54 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Metal Products - Distribution is currently in the top 7% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
One other stock from the same industry, Arconic (ARNC), is yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022.
This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.35 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +40%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.
Arconic's revenues are expected to be $2.03 billion, down 5.3% from the year-ago quarter.
5 Stocks Set to Double
Each was handpicked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2021. Previous recommendations have soared +143.0%, +175.9%, +498.3% and +673.0%.

2023-01-18,"Earnings season has quickly arrived at our doorstep, and investors are undoubtedly ready for compani","Earnings season has quickly arrived at our doorstep, and investors are undoubtedly ready for companies to pull the curtain back and unveil what’s transpired behind the scenes.
The big banks kicked off earnings season, and today we’ll receive quarterly results from companies including Alcoa Inc. AA, Discover Financial Services DFS, and Kinder Morgan Inc. KMI.
So far, there have been several companies stealing the spotlight in earnings season so far, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing TSM, United Air Lines UAL, and JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.
Below is a chart illustrating the year-to-date performance of all three stocks, with the S&P 500 blended in as a benchmark.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Let’s take a closer look at each one.
United Airlines
United Airlines transports passengers and cargo throughout North America and destinations in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America.
The company came out of the gates and reported EPS of $2.46, nearly 19% above our consensus estimate and reflecting a sizable year-over-year change.
Price, Consensus, and EPS

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Quarterly revenue was reported at $12.4 billion, roughly 1.4% above expectations and representing a 51% year-over-year increase.
Insiders must have known it was shaping up to be a strong quarter; Edward Shapiro, a director, purchased 25,000 UAL shares in December for roughly $1 million.
Scott Kirby, CEO, said, “Over the last three years, United has made critical investments in tools, infrastructure and our people – all of which are essential investments in our future. That’s why we’ve got a big head start, and we’re now poised to accelerate in 2023 as our United Next strategy becomes a reality.”
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is the world’s largest circuit foundry. Recently, the stock has come under a lot of attention following a purchase from the legendary Warren Buffett.
TSM exceeded the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate of $1.80 per share by roughly 1%, reporting EPS of $1.82. Quarterly revenue totaled $19.9 billion, marginally below our consensus estimate and reflecting a sizable 26% year-over-year increase.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
In addition, the company provided guidance for Q1 2023; TSM expects revenue in the range of $16.7 billion – $17.5 billion and a gross profit margin between 53.5% and 55.5%.
JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Headquartered in New York, JPMorgan Chase & Co. is one of the biggest global banks.
Many were anxious heading into the big banks’ releases, but JPM managed to exceed expectations; the company posted EPS of $3.57, nearly 15% above our $3.11 per share consensus estimate.
The financial titan generated $34.5 billion in revenue, roughly 2% ahead of estimates and reflecting an 18% change from the year-ago quarter.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Jamie Dimon, CEO, said, “Our lines of business performed well in the quarter, and we continued to see momentum in our areas of strategic focus. In Consumer & Community Banking, debit and credit card sales were up 9%, while card loans were up 19% with total revolving balances now back to pre-pandemic levels.
He continued, ""In the Corporate & Investment Bank, Markets revenue rose 7% as client activity remained strong in Fixed Income. Global Investment Banking fees were down significantly in a challenging environment, although we maintained our #1 ranking in 2022. Commercial Banking loans were up 14% on new loan originations and higher revolver utilization. And in Asset & Wealth Management, revenue increased 3% as higher net interest income more than offset the impact of lower market levels.”
Bottom Line
With earnings season kicking into higher gear, investors are more than ready to face the music and find out how the quarter went.
We’ll have a plethora of companies reporting for some time, but all three companies above – Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing TSM, United Air Lines UAL, and JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM – have gotten their results out of the way already, positively surprising investors.

2023-01-19,Those who hoped that 2023 would be a nice straight-up recovery from last year's bear market felt dis,"Those who hoped that 2023 would be a nice straight-up recovery from last year's bear market felt disappointed Thursday morning, as Wall Street saw stock market indexes give up some more ground after Wednesday's steep drop. Market participants cited concerns about earnings season, uncertainty about the Federal Reserve's next move, and brewing trouble in Washington over the statutory federal debt ceiling, and stock index futures were down almost 1% before the regular trading session started.
Investors have watched the latest financial reports from key companies to get a reading on the current state of the economy from the perspective of both consumers and businesses. The releases from Discover Financial Services (NYSE: DFS) and Alcoa (NYSE: AA) helped shed some light on how various parts of the economy are faring, and market participants did their best to draw useful conclusions that they can put to work in evaluating other industries as well.
Discover signals potential consumer weakness
Shares of Discover Financial Services were down 8% in premarket trading Thursday morning. The diversified financial company reported its fourth-quarter financial results, and shareholders saw a mix of strong asset growth but concerning trends among its consumer credit customer base.
Discover's financial results were reasonably solid. Net interest income jumped 24% year over year to $3.07 billion, and noninterest income vaulted higher by nearly half from year-ago levels. However, a big jump in Discover's provision for credit losses weighed on the bottom line, with net income falling 3% to $1.03 billion even as earnings per share rose 4% to $3.77.
Discover boasted record loan growth of 20% to $112 billion, with notable gains in both credit card balances and personal loans. Higher interest rates helped support wider net interest margins, also supporting the consumer finance company's results.
However, what spooked shareholders was news that Discover's charge-off rate jumped from 1.37% in the year-ago period to 2.13%, with a big spike higher in charge-offs on the credit card side just in the past three months. Delinquency rates saw similar gains, raising questions about the power of consumers to help the economy avoid a recession. Despite ongoing stock buybacks from Discover, investors aren't happy to see customers potentially having problems paying their card bills and loan balances, and that has the potential to continue into 2023.
Alcoa suffers sales declines, losses
Elsewhere, shares of Alcoa were down 6% in premarket trading. The aluminum company's fourth-quarter financial results showed ongoing headwinds from challenging market conditions and suggested those obstacles could remain in place for 2023.
Alcoa's financial results were weak. Revenue fell 20% year over year to $2.66 billion, although the aluminum company did manage to post a slightly higher sales figure for the full 2022 year than it did in 2021. Alcoa lost $123 million on an adjusted basis, working out to $0.70 per share and widening dramatically from its performance in the third quarter of 2022. Full-year adjusted earnings fell 29% to $4.83 per share.
High raw materials and energy costs weighed on Alcoa's results, particularly in conjunction with lower pricing in raw alumina and the broader aluminum markets in the fourth quarter. The aluminum specialist anticipates continuing to boost corporate efficiency in an effort to maintain cost discipline.
However, Alcoa anticipates that alumina shipments in 2023 could come in at 12.7 million to 12.9 million metric tons, down half a million tons from the past year. Flat aluminum shipments and rising costs could put continuing pressure on earnings. That doesn't bode well for Alcoa's near-term recovery hopes, and it signals that industrial buyers of lightweight metals might not be as healthy as investors would like.

2023-01-23,Wall Street moved slightly lower during the third trading week of 2023,"Wall Street moved slightly lower during the third trading week of 2023. My ""three stocks to avoid,"" which I thought were going to lose to the market in the past week -- Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ: BBBY), Alcoa (NYSE: AA), and ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) -- plunged 8%, dipped 7%, and closed flat, respectively, averaging out to a 5% decline.
The S&P 500 moved in the other direction, increasing 0.7% for the holiday-abridged week. It was close, but I was right. I have been correct in 43 of the past 66 weeks, or 65% of the time.
Let's turn our attention to the week ahead. I see Bed Bath & Beyond, D.R. Horton (NYSE: DHI), and Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA) as stocks you might want to consider steering clear of this week. Let's go over my near-term concerns with all three investments.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Bed Bath & Beyond
Singling out Bed Bath & Beyond for a second week is a dangerous game. I'm fairly confident where this story will end, but there will be short squeezes and other spikes along the way. The housewares retailer is in trouble. Sales growth is negative for the chain's fifth consecutive fiscal year, and losses are widening.
Remember the early days of the pandemic, when folks invested heavily in their homes to make themselves more comfortable during lockdown? Bed Bath & Beyond sales plummeted 17% that fiscal year, the first of what will be three straight years of double-digit declines on the top line. Shoppers had abandoned the chain before the pandemic, too, even as the economy and real estate market were heading in the right direction.
Bed Bath & Beyond is in bad shape. Its heavy debt load gives it not much to play with now. The investment will be volatile, and while that's par for the course for meme stocks, this is one where the best-case bullish scenario is difficult to spell out.
2. D.R. Horton
Homebuilders have had a good run, and valuations look tempting on a trailing basis. It's also earnings season, and D.R. Horton is reporting fresh financials on Tuesday morning. I'm still putting the Texas-based developer on this list.
D.R. Horton shares enter this week just 3% below its 52-week high, but you have to wonder why that's the case. The residential builder fell short of Wall Street earnings expectations when it posted fourth-quarter results for fiscal 2022 three months ago, making it a challenging hold heading into this week's update. Analysts have also been slashing their profit targets.
Wall Street pros were eyeing net income of $13.38 a share for the new fiscal year and $14.14 a share in fiscal 2024 just three months ago. The consensus estimate is now $9.61 and $9.74, respectively. The stock may seem cheap at just less than 10 times forward earnings, but you have to wonder if the projections will keep tumbling after 28% to 31% in downward revisions over just a couple of months.
Bulls will argue that we have a shortage of homes in this country, and they're not wrong. But new digs are likely to be priced lower on contracting margins.
3. Tesla Motors
It's not just D.R. Horton checking in with what could be problematic quarterly results this week. Tesla Motors will step up with its fourth-quarter results on Wednesday afternoon.
Tesla has done a lot of things right over the years, but these next two financial updates aren't likely to impress. Tesla had to discount December deliveries -- twice -- and it still fell short of market expectations for deliveries. The first quarter is likely to squeeze margins even harder with huge price cuts on its Model Y cars.
The stock is up 23% over the past dozen days despite weak demand prompting aggressive price cuts in the U.S. and China. Investors may be looking past the short-term hiccups, but they might rethink that stance if this week'searnings callis cloudy and unsettling.
It's going to be a bumpy road for some of these investments. If you're looking for safe stocks, you aren't likely to find them in Bed Bath & Beyond, D.R. Horton, and Tesla Motors this week.

2023-01-23,"By Andy Home
LONDON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Global aluminium production rose by a marginal 2","By Andy Home
LONDON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Global aluminium production rose by a marginal 2.0% last year, a rate of growth that was down from 2.7% in 2021 and the slowest since 2019, according to the International Aluminium Institute (IAI).
Output barely rose at all over the second half of the year. Annualised production of 69 million tonnes in December was just 231,000 tonnes higher than June's global run-rate.
Europe's energy crisis has taken a heavy toll on a notoriously power-hungry sector. Regional production fell by 12.5% last year, a major factor behind the 0.9% decline in output outside of China.
China, the world's dominant producer of primary aluminium, registered 4.0% output growth for the second consecutive year.
But it too has been grappling with power problems, most recently in the hydro-rich provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan. The country's annualised production peaked in August 2022 at 41.46 million tonnes, since when run-rates have fallen by 600,000 tonnes.
Aluminium's energy paradox is coming into ever sharper focus. Production of a metal that is critical for building a greener power system is itself increasingly vulnerable to fluctuating power availability.
EUROPE POWERS DOWN
Western European aluminium output was running at an annualised 2.73 million tonnes in December, down by 540,000 tonnes on December 2021 and the lowest production rate this century.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the resulting surge in power prices caused multiple smelter closures and curtailments last year.
Europe's energy crunch has now passed its peak. German baseload power for 2024 delivery TRDEBYZ4 has fallen from 470 euros/MWh in August to a current 189.
Some European aluminium capacity is returning. The Dunkerque plant, one of the region's largest with capacity of 285,000 tonnes per year, is reversing the 20% cuts made in the fourth quarter of 2022.
For some, though, it's probably too late.
Slovakia's sole smelter with capacity of 175,000 tonnes per year has closed all primary operations after 70 years of operation.
The Podgorica smelter in Montenegro closed the last 60,000 tonnes of primary capacity at the end of 2021.
Interestingly, both plants are counted in the IAI's Eastern Europe and Russia category. So too are smelters in Romania and Slovenia, both of which have drastically curtailed operations over the last year.
Yet regional production was down by only 1.4% last year, a counterintuitive outcome unless the closures were offset by higher output in Russia.
This is possible given Rusal was planning to fire up its new Taishet plant last year, although there has been no recent update on the 428,500-tonne per year project.
STOP START IN CHINA
China's production of 40.39 million tonnes of aluminium last year was a new annual record but the headline masks considerable chop and change in the country's base smelter network.
New capacity was brought on stream and mothballed capacity restarted in some provinces, while in others power restrictions translated into mandatory curtailments for smelter operators.
The balance flipped from fast growth in the first half of 2022 to sliding output over the closing months.
This year has seen no repeat of the blanket restrictions imposed during the 2021 winter energy crunch but drought in the southwest of the country is weighing on smelter operating rates. Some two million tonnes of capacity in Yunnan, Sichuan and Guizhou was off-line at the end of 2022, according to Shanghai Metal Market.
It's unlikely to return until the second quarter, when the rainy season should restore depleted reservoir levels in the region's hydro power system.
There is still plenty of room for production growth in China with the government capacity cap of 45 million tonnes not yet reached.
However, the last two years have shown that it is increasingly rare for China to run at its existing capacity for any prolonged period of time before power restrictions of one sort or another are imposed by provincial governments looking to balance energy loads.
GREEN PRESSURE
It's noticeable that the drought problems in China's southwest haven't deterred aluminium producers from transferring capacity there from coal-powered provinces in the quest for metal with a lower carbon footprint.
The pressure to go green is also becoming a key factor in smelter restarts in the rest of the world.
Latin America was the fastest-growing aluminium production region last year with output up 10.7% year on year. A key driver was the restart of the Alumar smelter in Brazil based on a switch to renewable power. Ramp-up is taking a bit longer than planned, according to 40% owner South32 S32.AX, which is not surprising since the plant last operated seven years ago.
Alcoa AA.N, which owns the balancing 60% stake in Alumar, is also hoping to restart its San Ciprian smelter in Spain after a switch to renewable energy. It has secured two wind-power deals which would cover 75% of energy needs for the 228,000-tonne per year plant.
Even Slovalco might be resuscitated by Norwegian owner Hydro NHY.OL if the Slovak government can implement the European Union's framework on carbon compensations.
POWER PARADOX
Yet the rush for renewable power merely accentuates the core aluminium paradox. As ever more smelters switch to green energy sources, global aluminium production is ever more dependent on seasonally variable power availability.
Moreover, seasonality itself is changing as global warming brings both longer droughts and hotter summer heat waves, which combine to lift energy usage while depressing power generation.
It has become clear in the last few years that China's aluminium smelters, along with other power-intensive industries, are first in line for mandated curtailments when a province is trying to balance its grid.
Such regional adjustments are now part and parcel of the global aluminium production landscape but they have injected a new degree of volatility into aluminium's previously slow-changing supply side.
They also raise the possibility that China's seemingly unstoppable aluminium juggernaut has run out of road even before reaching the government's capacity cap.

2023-02-02,"Investors in Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) saw new options begin trading today, for the March 24th ","Investors in Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) saw new options begin trading today, for the March 24th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AA options chain for the new March 24th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $53.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.35. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $53.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $49.65 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $53.51/share today.
Because the $53.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.32% return on the cash commitment, or 46.18% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $53.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $55.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.15. If an investor was to purchase shares of AA stock at the current price level of $53.51/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $55.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.67% if the stock gets called away at the March 24th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $55.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.89% boost of extra return to the investor, or 43.01% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $53.51) to be 67%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2023-02-03,Feb 3(Reuters) - Alcoa Corp AA,"Feb 3(Reuters) - Alcoa Corp AA.N said on Friday that a majority of workers at its San Ciprian facility in Spain voted to back its plan for a phased restart of the aluminum smelter in January 2024 after a two-year halt to primary production.
The U.S. metals producer had reached a deal with workers in December 2021 to end primary aluminum production at the facility for two years as soaring European energy prices threatened its viability.
The phased restart will be completed by Oct. 1, 2025, and from then until the end of 2026, the aluminum smelter will produce at least 75% of its nominal capacity of 228,000 metric tons per year, Alcoa said.
Last year, the company signed two long-term wind power purchase agreements securing roughly 75% of the smelter's needs at full capacity, it added.
The plan includes $146 million of capital investments, mainly for a new anode plant, and an extended commitment not to initiate any collective dismissal processes for three years after the restart begins, the company said.
In 2020, the company attempted to lay off some 500 workers but was forced to abandon the plan after a Spanish court declared it ""null and void.""
Alcoa has long sought to shut down the smelter in Spain's northwestern Galicia region, which has struggled to remain competitive in the face of steep energy costs and low aluminium prices, leading to several years of losses.

2023-02-24,"Updates prices, adds analysts comment
WASHINGTON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The United States will impose ","Updates prices, adds analysts comment
WASHINGTON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The United States will impose a 200% tariff on aluminum and derivatives produced in Russia from March 10, the White House said on Friday, effectively a ban as it announced sanctions on the anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The United States will also apply a 200% tariff on aluminum imports of primary aluminum produced in Russia from April 10.
""President Biden has made it a priority to mitigate the effects of Russia’s invasion on domestic industries critical to our national security, and this includes the American aluminum industry,"" the U.S. Department of Commerce said.
""In imposing these tariffs, we are denying Russia an important market for its aluminum while taking a stand for America’s workers.""
Russian aluminum is produced by Rusal RUAL.MM, 0486.HK which accounts for about 6% of global supplies.
""Alcoa welcomes the imposition of tariffs by the U.S. government on Russian aluminum,"" the U.S. aluminum producer said. ""We continue to advocate for sanctions as the most effective means for the government to take action against Russia and level the playing field for U.S. producers.""
Neither Russian metal nor the companies that produce it have been targeted by sanctions imposed on some Russian companies in response to Russia sending troops into Ukraine last year.
In 2018, however, U.S. Treasury Department sanctions on Rusal froze the bulk of the company's exports, paralyzed its supply chain and scared off customers.
The sanctions also fueled a jump in aluminum prices on the London Metal Exchange.
LME prices on Friday shrugged of news of the tariffs because they don't stop consumers and traders in other countries frombuying Russian aluminium and supplies are for now ample, metals analysts said.
Prices CMAL3 of aluminum, vital for transport, packaging and construction industries, were down 2.5% at $2,337 a tonne at 1652 GMT. Earlier they touched $2,321.5, the lowest since Jan 9.
The tariffs are unlikely to significantly tighten the aluminium market in the United States as the country imports only a small percentage of its aluminium from Russia.
U.S. imports of unwrought aluminum and alloys from Russia amounted to 191,809 tonnes, or roughly 4.4% of the more than 4.4 million tonne total last year, compared with 8.9% in 2018 and 14.6% in 2017, according to Trade Data Monitor.
Rusal declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.

Mativ Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.40 on 3/24/23, Kronos Worldwide Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.19 on 3/16/23, and Alcoa Corporation will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.10 on 3/23/23. As a percentage of MATV's recent stock price of $25.57, this dividend works out to approximately 1.56%, so look for shares of Mativ Inc to trade 1.56% lower — all else being equal — when MATV shares open for trading on 3/6/23. Similarly, investors should look for KRO to open 1.69% lower in price and for AA to open 0.20% lower, all else being equal.
Below are dividend history charts for MATV, KRO, and AA, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared.
Mativ Inc (Symbol: MATV):
Kronos Worldwide Inc (Symbol: KRO):
Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA):
In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 6.26% for Mativ Inc, 6.75% for Kronos Worldwide Inc, and 0.80% for Alcoa Corporation.

2023-03-03,"In recent trading, shares of Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) have crossed above the average analyst 1","In recent trading, shares of Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $53.62, changing hands for $53.69/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher — if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.
There are 8 different analyst targets within the Zacks coverage universe contributing to that average for Alcoa Corporation, but the average is just that — a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $42.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $65.00. The standard deviation is $7.386.
But the whole reason to look at the average AA price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with AA crossing above that average target price of $53.62/share, investors in AA have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $53.62 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Alcoa Corporation:

2023-03-07,"Investors in Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) saw new options begin trading today, for the June 2024 e","Investors in Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) saw new options begin trading today, for the June 2024 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 472 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AA options chain for the new June 2024 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of $9.55. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $50.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $40.45 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $51.46/share today.
Because the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 19.10% return on the cash commitment, or 14.77% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $50.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $55.00 strike price has a current bid of $11.50. If an investor was to purchase shares of AA stock at the current price level of $51.46/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $55.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 29.23% if the stock gets called away at the June 2024 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $55.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 7% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 22.35% boost of extra return to the investor, or 17.28% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $51.46) to be 65%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Investors will be hoping for strength from Alcoa as it approaches its next earnings release. On that day, Alcoa is projected to report earnings of $0.04 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 98.69%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $2.65 billion, down 19.55% from the year-ago period.
For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $2.42 per share and revenue of $10.52 billion, which would represent changes of -49.9% and -15.55%, respectively, from the prior year.

Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. Alcoa is currently a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).
Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Alcoa has a Forward P/E ratio of 18.51 right now. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 11.93.
Investors should also note that AA has a PEG ratio of 5.99 right now. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Metal Products - Distribution industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 5.71 as of yesterday's close.
The Metal Products - Distribution industry is part of the Industrial Products sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 103, putting it in the top 41% of all 250+ industries.

March 15 (Reuters) - The Australian unit of U.S. aluminium producer Alcoa Corp AA.N said on Wednesday output at its Portland smelter in Victoria would be reduced to about 75% of its total capacity of 358,000 metric tonnes per year, citing instability and production challenges.
Australia's Alumina Ltd AWC.AX owns a 40% stake in Alcoa Australia, which holds a 55% stake in the Portland Aluminium joint venture.
The smelter, which was previously operating at about 95% of its total capacity, is contending with uncertainty and hurdles related to the production of rodded anodes necessary to transport electricity into the smelting pots, Alcoa Australia said in a statement.
""Our teams are focused on safely taking the production offline and working to restore stability across the facility,"" Rob Bear, vice president for operations at Alcoa's domestic business, said.
The cut in production will begin immediately, it said, without setting out a timeline on when the smelter would return to full capacity.
Alcoa's local unit had, earlier this year, flagged a 30% production cut at its partially owned Kwinana alumina refinery due to a gas supply shortfall.

We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.
In the case of Alcoa Corporation, the RSI reading has hit 29.6 — by comparison, the universe of metals and mining stocks covered by Metals Channel currently has an average RSI of 40.2, the RSI of Spot Gold is at 14.0, and the RSI of Spot Silver is presently 22.9. A bullish investor could look at AA's 29.6 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.
Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), AA's low point in its 52 week range is $33.55 per share, with $98.09 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $39.48. Alcoa Corporation shares are currently trading off about 11.4% on the day.

March 16 (Reuters) - London copper prices bounced back on Thursday from a more than two-month low hit in the previous session, as authorities pledged liquidity support to Swiss bank Credit Suisse Group and consumption improved in top consumer China.
Credit Swiss CSGN.S, whose shares plunged 30% on Wednesday to a record low amid concerns of its financial strength, planned to borrow from the Swiss National Bank to boost liquidity, shortly after Swiss authorities pledged support to the lender.
Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange CMCU3 rose 0.9% to $8,581.50 a tonne by 0512 GMT. The contract in the previous session hit $8,489.50 a tonne, its lowest since Jan. 6, on Credit Suisse's rout.
A sign of demand picking up in top consumer China also supported prices, with Yangshan copper premium SMM-CUYP-CN - which reflects demand for imported copper into China - rose to $35 a tonne on Wednesday, its highest since Jan. 9.
""(Copper) looks cheap (and was) unduly sold off,"" said a metals trader, adding that physical consumers were buying when prices fell, but trading volume was tepid on risk aversion amid uncertainty in the global banking sector.
LME aluminium CMAL3 rose 0.6% to $2,291 a tonne, zinc CMZN3 eased 0.5% to $2,853 a tonne, lead CMPB3 advanced 0.5% to $2,080 a tonne while tin CMSN3 lost 2.2% to $21,960 a tonne.
The premium of SHFE first-month aluminium over the three-month contract was at 25 yuan a tonne, the first premium since Jan. 5, indicating tightening nearby supplies.
The Australian unit of U.S. aluminium producer Alcoa Corp AA.N announced a production cut at its Portland smelter in Victoria to about 75% of its total capacity of 358,000 metric tonnes per year, citing instability and production challenges.
The most-traded April copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange SCFcv1 fell 2.7% to 66,950 yuan ($9,700.09) a tonne, tracking overnight losses in London and dropping to as low as 66,590 yuan a tonne, its lowest since Jan. 10.
SHFE aluminium SAFcv1 declined 1.1% to 18,150 yuan a tonne, nickel SNIcv1 fell 2.9% to 172,850 yuan a tonne, zinc SZNcv1 shed 2.6% to 22,285 yuan a tonne and tin SSNcv1 tumbled as much as 4.5% to 178,760 yuan a tonne, its lowest since November last year.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AA options chain for the new May 5th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $41.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.05. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $41.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $37.95 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $41.41/share today.
Because the $41.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.44% return on the cash commitment, or 63.15% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $41.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $42.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.15. If an investor was to purchase shares of AA stock at the current price level of $41.41/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $42.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.03% if the stock gets called away at the May 5th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $42.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $42.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.61% boost of extra return to the investor, or 64.57% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $41.41) to be 65%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Alcoa will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Alcoa to post earnings of -$0.07 per share.

AA's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $2.35 per share and revenue of $10.52 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -51.35% and -15.55%, respectively.
Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Alcoa. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.
Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.

Looking at its valuation, Alcoa is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 17.1. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 11.68.
Also, we should mention that AA has a PEG ratio of 5.74. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. Metal Products - Distribution stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 5.24 based on yesterday's closing prices.
The Metal Products - Distribution industry is part of the Industrial Products sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 33, which puts it in the top 14% of all 250+ industries.

Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $42.30) to be 65%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Heading into today, shares of the bauxite, alumina and aluminum products company had lost 22.22% over the past month, lagging the Industrial Products sector's loss of 2.52% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.28% in that time.
Investors will be hoping for strength from Alcoa as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be April 19, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Alcoa to post earnings of -$0.05 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 101.63%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $2.7 billion, down 18.16% from the prior-year quarter.
For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $2.11 per share and revenue of $10.64 billion, which would represent changes of -56.31% and -14.52%, respectively, from the prior year.
It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Alcoa. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.
Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.
The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Looking at its valuation, Alcoa is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 19.77. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 11.72, which means Alcoa is trading at a premium to the group.
We can also see that AA currently has a PEG ratio of 6.63. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. Metal Products - Distribution stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 5.71 based on yesterday's closing prices.
The Metal Products - Distribution industry is part of the Industrial Products sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 14, which puts it in the top 6% of all 250+ industries.

Alcoa Declares $0.10 Dividend
On February 23, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share ($0.40 annualized). Shareholders of record as of March 7, 2023 received the payment on March 23, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.10 per share.
At the current share price of $41.77 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 0.96%. Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 1.61%, the lowest has been 0.43%, and the highest has been 7.05%. The standard deviation of yields is 1.17 (n=237).
The current dividend yield is 0.56 standard deviations below the historical average.
Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is -0.70. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.
The company has not increased its dividend in the last three years.

2023-04-06,"Investors in Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) saw new options become available today, for the May 26th","Investors in Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) saw new options become available today, for the May 26th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AA options chain for the new May 26th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $37.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.51. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $37.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $34.49 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $38.53/share today.
Because the $37.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.78% return on the cash commitment, or 49.52% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $37.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $39.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.10. If an investor was to purchase shares of AA stock at the current price level of $38.53/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $39.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.27% if the stock gets called away at the May 26th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $39.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $39.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 8.05% boost of extra return to the investor, or 58.73% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $38.53) to be 65%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

We’re still mostly flat to start another day of trading, which suggests","Tuesday, April 11th, 2023

We’re still mostly flat to start another day of trading, which suggests tomorrow morning’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for March is what market participants are awaiting before pushing or pulling markets in any particular direction. As we’ve already pointed out yesterday, an Inflation Rate of +6% in February looks to take on a 5-handle for the first time since September of 2021.

The only index looking to creep ahead of the CPI number is the small-cap Russell 2000, but this may be in the service of a realignment of small-cap stocks relative to the rest of equities, which had gotten out of whack over the past few weeks. This was likely in line with fears that the regional bank crisis was more meaningful with smaller growth names, and the hedge was against any contagion in that space. But with that threat seemingly having abated by now, small-caps are now moving to where the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 have been trading for the past week or two.

It’s not just CPI results we’re awaiting, either: the Producer Price Index (PPI) comes out Thursday, along with Weekly Jobless Claims — which are now readjusted to include the new climate of heavier layoffs, and not just in Tech — and Retail Sales results on Friday. The two main economic pillars that have looked resistant to higher interest rates have been the labor market and consumer spending. Both of these will have been addressed as of the month of March by the end of this week.

Let us not forget Q1 earnings season, either. In the olden days, before Alcoa AA split up, its early quarterly report was considered to have kicked off a new season of earnings results. Now there’s more of a trickle into the big Wall Street banks — JPMorgan JPM, Citigroup C and Wells Fargo WFC — which report on Friday. Delta Air Lines DAL reports a day earlier, and Paris-based luxury retailer LVMH LVMUY a day earlier than that.

On the labor force aspect of things, Goldman Sachs is out this morning with a report explaining how labor supply in the U.S. has fully recovered to pre-Covid trends, three years after a massive crater of layoffs took a robust American economy into a deep but short-lived recession. Higher wages welcomed many workers back into the fold over time (which helped inflation get its hooks in the economy), but now, according to Goldman, with more labor supply we’re now seeing lower wage gains — and this will assist in bringing inflation down.

2023-04-13,"Investors in Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) saw new options begin trading today, for the June 2nd ex","Investors in Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) saw new options begin trading today, for the June 2nd expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AA options chain for the new June 2nd contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $40.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.92. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $40.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $37.08 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $40.55/share today.
Because the $40.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.30% return on the cash commitment, or 53.29% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $40.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $41.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.10. If an investor was to purchase shares of AA stock at the current price level of $40.55/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $41.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.75% if the stock gets called away at the June 2nd expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $41.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $41.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.64% boost of extra return to the investor, or 55.81% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $40.55) to be 65%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

The company has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters.

Let’s see how things are shaping up for Alcoa this earnings season.
Alcoa Price and EPS Surprise
Alcoa price-eps-surprise | Alcoa Quote
Factors to Note
Lower prices in Alumina and Aluminum segments are likely to have weighed on AA’s top line in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues in the first quarter indicates a 19.2% decline from the year-ago quarter.

Weakness in Alumina shipments due to the partial curtailment of the San Ciprian refinery and lower bauxite quality at the Australian refineries is likely to have impacted AA’s first-quarter performance.

High raw material and energy costs, primarily in Europe due to war tensions, are expected to have dented Alcoa’s bottom line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings hints at a more than 100% drop from the year-ago reported number.

The Aluminum segment is likely to have put up a weak show due to softness in shipments, thanks to expectations of lower trading volume.
What Does the Zacks Model Say?
Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Alcoa this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates, which is not the case here, as elaborated below. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Earnings ESP: Alcoa has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 5 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

Zacks Rank: Alcoa currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.
Highlights of Q4 Earnings
Alcoa incurred an adjusted loss of 70 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2022, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 85 cents. In the year-ago period, the company had reported adjusted earnings of $2.50. Total revenues of $2.66 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.67%. The top line jumped 25.6% year over year.
Stocks to Consider
Here are some companies you may want to consider from the Zacks Industrial Products sector, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this season:

A. O. Smith AOS has an Earnings ESP of +5.78% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is scheduled to release first-quarter 2023 results on Apr 27.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for A. O. Smith’s first-quarter earnings has remained steady in the past 60 days. The company pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 3.2%, on average.

Graco Inc. GGG has an Earnings ESP of +2.44% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is slated to release first-quarter 2023 results on Apr 26.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Graco’s first-quarter earnings has remained steady in the past 60 days. The company delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 0.2%, on average.

2023-04-17,Alcoa (NYSE:AA) is expected to publish its Q1 2023 results on April 19 reporting on a quarter that s,"Alcoa (NYSE:AA) is expected to publish its Q1 2023 results on April 19 reporting on a quarter that saw aluminum prices face considerable volatility. We expect the company’s revenues to come in at about $2.76 billion, roughly in line with the consensus estimates. While this would mark a sequential increase of about 4%, it would translate into a year-over-year decline of around 16%. We estimate that earnings will stand at just $0.05 per share, slightly ahead of the consensus, although this would mark a decline from levels of around $2.49 in the year-ago period. So what are some of the trends that are likely to drive Alcoa’s results? See our interactive dashboard analysis on Alcoa Earnings Preview for more details on how AA’s revenues and earnings are likely to trend for the quarter.
Aluminum prices have been quite volatile in recent months, rising from $2,300 per ton in early January to about $2,650 by the end of January, due to optimism surrounding the post-Covid re-opening in China. However, prices fell to about $2,400 by the end of March. Aluminum output from China has been expanding, driven by relaxed power restrictions and new capacity coming online and this has also been putting a lid on price appreciation. Moreover, Alcoa’s production is also facing some headwinds due to the high price of natural gas, particularly in European countries such as Spain and Norway. The higher costs could also impact margins and earnings. The company is also likely to be impacted by the lower quality of bauxite at its Australian refineries. Although Alcoa has not provided specific guidance for Q1 2023, it expects to ship between 2.5 and 2.6 million metric tons of aluminum in 2023, consistent with 2022, while alumina shipments are projected to decline a bit.
However, we still remain positive on AA stock. Alcoa stock has already declined by over 55% from levels seen around March 2022 and remains down almost 14% year-to-date. Moreover, rising investments in the renewable energy sector including electric vehicles, charging infrastructure, and solar and wind power plants remain secular drivers for aluminum demand. We think that Alcoa has an edge over other aluminum producers given its strong balance sheet (net debt of about $440 million) and also due to the fact that its facilities are largely based in the U.S., resulting in lower energy costs compared to European rivals. We value AA stock at $48 per share, about 20% ahead of the current market price. See our analysis of Alcoa valuation for a closer look at what’s driving our price estimate for Alcoa and how Alcoa’s valuation compares with peers. Also, see our analysis of Alcoa Revenue for more details on how Alcoa’s revenues are expected to trend.

LONDON, April 18 (Reuters) - Supply disruptions in top producer China due to probl","By Pratima Desai
LONDON, April 18 (Reuters) - Supply disruptions in top producer China due to problems with hydro power mean hefty shortages of aluminium this year, which are likely to offset slow demand growth and help bolster prices.
Smelter shutdowns in Europe due to high energy prices over the past couple of years and consumers there shunning Russian metal after Moscow invaded Ukraine last year make the problem particularly acute in the region.
Despite expectations of tight supplies, aluminium prices CMAL3 on the London Metal Exchange (LME) have come under pressure due to interest rate hikes in the United States and sluggish demand in top consumer China.
At $2,400 a tonne, they have dropped 10% since mid-January.
However, in recent weeks deficits have emerged, as seen in sliding inventories of aluminium used in the transport, construction and packaging industries.
In warehouses monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchanges, aluminium stocks AL-STX-SGH at 274,347 tonnes have dropped 12% over the last month. In LME approved warehouses, stocks MALSTX-TOTAL have fallen 5% since mid-February.
Chinese production should rise, but at a slower pace than previously forecast due to power rationing and disruptions in provinces such as Yunnan where aluminium is mostly smelted using hydro electricity.
""China's smelters remain under pressure because of hydro power shortages. At the same time, demand should pick up, so exports will likely remain capped,"" said Bank of America analyst Michael Widmer. ""We expect rising deficits going forward.""
Widmer expects an aluminium market deficit of 1.53 million tonnes this year and a shortage of 1.93 million tonnes next.
Meanwhile, in Europe lower power prices have helped to reduce production costs, but smelter restarts are limited.
A scramble for supplies has since mid-January fuelled a 20% jump in the duty-paid aluminium premiums buyers in Europe EPDc1 pay in the physical market - above the LME price - to $330 a tonne.
""Physical premiums managed to hold up in Europe where supply constraints remain following the large smelter cuts last year and Russian metal being diverted to Asia,"" Macquarie analysts said in a note.
""Given more Russian metal is expected to flow to China, there should be fundamental support for physical premiums.""
Macquarie forecasts an aluminium market deficit of 670,000 tonnes this year and global consumption at 70.8 million tonnes.

2023-04-19,Alcoa (AA) came out with a quarterly loss of $0,"Alcoa (AA) came out with a quarterly loss of $0.23 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.05. This compares to earnings of $3.06 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -360%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this bauxite, alumina and aluminum products company would post a loss of $0.85 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.70, delivering a surprise of 17.65%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.
Alcoa, which belongs to the Zacks Metal Products - Distribution industry, posted revenues of $2.67 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.31%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.29 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.
The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.
Alcoa shares have lost about 7.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 8.2%.
What's Next for Alcoa?
While Alcoa has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?
There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.
Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Alcoa: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.44 on $2.67 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.09 on $10.73 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Metal Products - Distribution is currently in the top 26% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
One other stock from the same industry, Arconic (ARNC), is yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2023.
This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.21 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -46.2%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.
Arconic's revenues are expected to be $1.82 billion, down 17% from the year-ago quarter.

Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is -0.09. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.
The company has not increased its dividend in the last three years.

LONDON, April 21 (Reuters) - Global primary aluminium production grew by 2","By Andy Home
LONDON, April 21 (Reuters) - Global primary aluminium production grew by 2.0% year-on-year to 16.9 million tonnes in the first three months of 2023, according to the latest monthly assessment from the International Aluminium Institute (IAI).
The headline growth figure flatters to deceive.
Production outside of China is flat-lining, with restarts and curtailments largely cancelling each other out.
China, which accounts for just under 60% of the world's primary metal production, lifted output by 3.9% relative to the first quarter of 2022, but the growth rate slowed sharply to just 0.9% in March.
Expressed in terms of annualised run-rates, China's output of 39.9 million tonnes last month was the lowest in a year and down by 1.6 million tonnes from August's record 41.5 million.
New and restarted capacity is failing to offset lower production in the hydro-rich province of Yunnan, where power-hungry smelters have been ordered to reduce operations to help cope with a severe drought.
China's aluminium production is now highly dependent on weather patterns in the south of the country. So too is the global aluminium market.
PRAYING FOR RAIN
Yunnan province accounts for around 12% of China's aluminium capacity and produced 4.2 million tonnes in 2022.
It has been a fast-growing production hub as Chinese operators have migrated from coal-powered provinces in a quest to produce low-carbon ""green"" aluminium using hydro energy.
Hydro power, however, requires rainfall and Yunnan is experiencing its worst drought in decades.
The provincial capital Kunming, which has received only 10% of its normal precipitation so far this year, earlier this week issued an orange drought alert, the second most severe warning in a four-tiered system. Many other towns have done the same, according to China Daily.
Industrial energy users, including aluminium smelters, have been instructed to reduce operations to balance the power system.
Around two million tonnes of the province's production capacity is now off-line, according to Li Jiahui, an analyst at consultancy Shanghai Metals Market, speaking at a conference in Zhengzhou.
While other provinces have restarted capacity or even brought on new electrolysis lines, the impact has failed to offset the losses in Yunnan.
In theory things will turn around with the approaching rainy season, but in practice it will depend on just how much rain falls and whether there will be sufficient guaranteed power to allow smelters to commit to the costs of reactivating idled capacity.
WESTERN PRODUCTION FLAT-LINES
Primary aluminium production outside of China was flat year-on-year in the first quarter.
Only two regions registered significant changes relative to the first three months of 2022.
Latin American production surged by 24% thanks to the ramp-up of the Alumar smelter in Brazil, which is being restarted after six years of care and maintenance, and the return to full operations of the Aluar plant in Argentina.
However, the region is a relatively small producer and even with the stellar growth rate accounted for just 5% of non-Chinese production in the first quarter.
At the other end of the spectrum lies Western Europe, where first-quarter production was down by 10% on last year.
High energy prices have forced multiple smelters to idle capacity over the last year, and annualised run-rates in the region have fallen to multi-year lows of 2.7 million tonnes.
Output appears to be bottoming out, with no new announcements of curtailments and Norwegian producer Hydro NHY.OL negotiating a last-minute deal to avoid a potentially protracted strike at two of its smelters.
Next year will see the return of the San Ciprian smelter in Spain, which Alcoa AA.N will restart after two years of idling with new renewable power agreements.
Others may also reactivate curtailed capacity if power prices hold their lower levels after spiking in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
WEATHER WATCH
However, China's dominant position in the global aluminium picture means that it holds the key to future production patterns.
And the key variable within China is Yunnan, which can churn out as much metal as all the smelters in North and Latin America combined.
Both the global supply chain and the aluminium price are becoming ever more dependent on rainfall patterns in southern China.
Seasonality is a new source of volatility for a metal that was previously defined by the predictable nature of the continuous aluminium smelter process.
Aluminium's green energy-transition ambitions come with a big green production caveat.

TOKYO, April 27 (Reuters) - The premiums for aluminium shipments to Japanese buyer","By Yuka Obayashi
TOKYO, April 27 (Reuters) - The premiums for aluminium shipments to Japanese buyers for April to June were set at $125-$130 a tonne, up 45-53% from the previous quarter, to reflect higher spot premiums elsewhere in Asia, four people directly involved in pricing talks said.
The figures compare with $85-$86 per tonne paid in the January-March quarter and mark the first quarterly increase in six quarters. The higher prices are in line with or lower than the initial offers of $125-$145 per tonne made by producers.
Japan is Asia's biggest importer of the light metal and the premiums PREM-ALUM-JP for primary metal shipments it agrees to pay each quarter over the benchmark London Metal Exchange (LME) cash price CMAL0 set the benchmark for the region.
The hike reflected higher premiums in other Asian markets such as South Korea while the premiums in the United States and Europe remained at high levels, a source from a Japanese trading house said.
""We had to compromise to agree at $130 this week as a producer was not going to lower its offer any further,"" a source at a Japanese fabricator said.
Both sides share the view that local demand for the light metal remains weak due to slow recovery in automobile production, causing high levels of inventories.
Aluminium stocks at three major Japanese ports AL-STK-JPPRT stood at 370,700 tonnes at the end of March, above 354,300 tonnes a year earlier, according to Marubeni Corp 8002.T.
But lower import during the last quarter will likely trim the inventory in the coming months, another source at a producer said.
Japan's import of aluminium and aluminium alloys in January-March declined by 23% from a year earlier, the trade data shows.
The quarterly pricing talks, which began in late February between Japanese buyers and global suppliers, including Rio Tinto Ltd RIO.AX and South32 Ltd S32.AX, have dragged on for a month longer than usual because of a wide gap in two sides' market outlooks. The last round of talks also lasted long.

2023-04-27,There's been a lot of buzz lately about the US potentially heading towards a recession this year,"There's been a lot of buzz lately about the US potentially heading towards a recession this year. That’s a serious issue, and it should prompt investors to start getting creative in portfolio allocation. One idea is to take advantage of growth-oriented sectors – and to start thinking globally for where to find them.
Banking giant Goldman Sachs has done much of the footwork, and the firm’s chief US equity strategist David Kostin has pointed out that China’s pullback from the zero-COVID lockdown policies is likely to ignite a commodities boom. With pundits from the International Monetary Fund and Bloomberg adding their voices – estimating that China will contribute more than 22% of total global economic growth this year – Kostin notes that the metal and mining sectors are best positioned to gain heavily from Chinese demand.
“Metals & Mining stocks stand to benefit from continued China economic growth. China accounts for about half of global demand for industrial metals such as aluminum and copper... US mining companies are not heavily reliant on China as an export market but stand to benefit indirectly from China demand through higher global metals prices,"" Kostin explained.
Stock analyst Emily Chieng, one of Goldman’s mining industry experts, is running with Kostin’s lead, and picking out metal stocks that stand to gain in a commodities boom. Using TipRanks, the world’s biggest database of analysts and research, we've pulled up the details on three of these stock picks, which are offering up to 60% upside potential.
Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF)
We’ll start with Cleveland-Cliffs, a major producer of flat-rolled steel in the US market, with a diversified portfolio of finished steel products. This company got its start in the mining business, and still operates iron mines in upper Michigan and northern Minnesota, that feed the firm’s steelmaking, metal stamping, tooling production, and tubular component production. In addition to its leading position in the flat-rolled steel segment, Cleveland-Cliffs is also a leader in the production of automotive-grade steel products.
Cleveland-Cliffs benefits greatly from its position as a producer of iron ore, and in addition, the company also mines coking coal, with a mining facility in West Virginia and coking facilities, which turn the raw coal into a vital ingredient for steel-making, in West Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. The company's steel and steel products have applications in manufacturing and packaging, as well as the appliance, auto, equipment, construction, and energy industries.
While revenues and earnings have decreased in recent quarters, they have still managed to exceed expectations. In the most recent release, for 1Q23, the company had a top line of $5.3 billion, down 11% from the year-ago period – but the Q1 result beat analyst expectations by $90 million. The bottom line non-GAAP EPS of 11 cents was a far cry from the $1.50 reported in 1Q22, but was a penny better than the forecast.
The company reported total steel sales of 4.1 million tons in Q1, for a year-over-year increase of 14%. The increase in volume sold partially offset a reduction in average net selling price.
In a development that bodes well for the company’s balance sheet, the firm reported $1.65 billion in borrowings under its credit facilities during Q1, and made $1.34 billion in payments against that debt. Cleveland-Cliffs has stated a commitment to paying down short-term revolver debt, and to that end, on April 14, the company announced closure on an offering of unsecured guaranteed notes, to the total of $750 million and due in 2030, at 6.75% annually. Net proceeds from this offering will be used to repay revolver credit borrowings.
That forms the background for the comments by Goldman Sachs' Emily Chieng, who says of this company: ""We believe fixed-price contract renegotiation at higher levels and line of sight on sequential cost reduction will drive margin improvement for CLF this year versus second half of last year, particularly as natural gas prices sit below our forecasts. Further, we expect volume growth of ~8% versus prior year to be driven by automotive end markets on improving supply chain efficiencies, low dealer inventories, and healthy consumer backlogs. While CLF has made progress on improving its balance sheet last year, we continue to expect a focus on deleveraging and remain focused on share buybacks.”
Chieng complements her comments with a Buy rating on CLF shares, and a $24 price target that implies a one-year gain of ~60%. (To watch Chieng’s track record, click here)
Overall, there are 5 recent analyst reviews on record for this stock, and they include 2 Buys and 3 Holds – for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The stock is priced at $15 and its $22 average price target implies ~47% upside on the one-year horizon. (See CLF stock forecast)
Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)
Now we’ll take a look at Freeport-McMoRan, a straight-out mining firm with a major position in the production of molybdenum, copper, and gold. The company, from its base in Phoenix, Arizona, has extensive mining operations in both North and South America, and operates one of the world’s largest copper and gold mines, the Grasberg mine in Indonesia’s Papua region. Freeport-McMoRan is the world’s largest producer of molybdenum.
Metals prices have been experiencing a surge due to high demand, with copper showing a particularly notable upward trend in recent years. The metal is up 19.5% from a trough last June, and has gained  more than 25% in the last 5 years. Freeport-McMoRan produced 832 million pounds of copper in 1Q23, along with 19 million pounds of molybdenum and 270,000 ounces of gold. The company foresees total consolidated sales this year of 4.1 billion pounds of copper, 79 million pounds of molybdenum, and 1.8 million ounces of gold. In the first quarter of this year, the company realized an average price of $4.11 per pound of copper, $30.32 per pound of molybdenum, and $1,949 per ounce for gold.
Those production and price numbers generated the firm’s total Q1 revenue of $5.39 billion, which was down 18% y/y but came in $140 million better than expected. The non-GAAP EPS of 52 cents was less than half the $1.07 reported in 1Q22, but beat the forecast by 6 cents, or 13%. Freeport-McMoRan is supporting its mining ops with extensive exploration activities; the company’s exploration expense in Q1 was up 29% y/y, to $31 million.
All of this adds up to a clear buying opportunity, in the eyes of Goldman's Chieng, who writes: “We continue to view FCX favorably on consistent operational execution, leverage to copper price upside, and medium-to-long term brownfield growth optionality, and maintain our 12-month price target at $47.”
Chieng’s Buy rating on the stock, and her $47 price target, suggest a 27% upside potential for the year ahead.
Overall, FCX gets a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 12 recent reviews that include 6 Buys, 5 Holds, and 1 Sell. The shares are priced at $36.87, and their one-year average price target of $46.67 implies a potential gain of ~27%. (See FCX stock forecast)
Alcoa (AA)
Last on our list of Goldman metal/mining picks is a name that may be familiar: Alcoa. Based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Alcoa is a perennial member of the global ‘top 10’ in aluminum producers, and is known for its production of high-end primary aluminum, fabricated aluminum, and alumina products. Alcoa’s aluminum end products are found in a wide range of products and industries, from automobiles and bicycles to airplanes and spacecraft, and even to such everyday items as home appliances and cookware.
The company has felt pressure from the usual macroeconomic headwinds, in the form of high inflation and interest rates, along with supply chain disruptions, combining to increase the cost of production. At the same time, Alcoa has remained profitable – and has even achieved its industry’s lowest carbon footprint.
The effects of this can be seen in Alcoa’s recent 1Q23 earnings release, and in its outlook for Q2. The company had a Q1 top line of $2.67 billion, down almost 19% year-over-year and missing the forecast by $90 million. The bottom line EPS, in non-GAAP terms, came to a net loss of 23 cents per share – where the Street had expected a break-even. Looking ahead, Alcoa is expecting a $115 million increase in the cost of energy and raw materials to offset a predicted increase in the realized third-party prices of both alumina and aluminum.
In some positive notes, the company’s EBITDA passed $1 billion in 1Q23, setting a company record, and Alcoa finished the quarter with a solid cash balance of $1.1 billion, giving the company deep pockets to withstand a difficult economic situation.
Goldman’s Chieng is bullish on Alcoa, seeing the company as more than capable of expanding its business despite the headwinds. Putting her thoughts in a recent note, she writes: “We continue to view AA positively, driven by (1) ~9% aluminum volume growth in the next two years (driven by production restarts) and (2) the company’s leverage to aluminum price upside which remains the more important driver of the company’s earnings profile; specifically, on our ~$2,700/t assumption for 2023, we estimate that the aluminum segment comprises ~75% of attributable EBITDA.”
Quantifying her stance, Chieng gives Alcoa stock a price target of $54 alongside a Buy rating; this implies an upside of 51% on the one-year time frame.
Even though the Goldman view is bullish here, Wall Street is taking a more cautious approach. Alcoa shares have a Hold rating from the analyst consensus, based on 8 reviews that include 3 Buys, 4 Holds, and 1 Sell. However, the stock’s $35.83 trading price and $47.75 average price target suggest a one-year upside potential of 34%. (See AA stock forecast)

2023-04-27,"Investors in Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) saw new options become available today, for the June 9th","Investors in Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) saw new options become available today, for the June 9th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AA options chain for the new June 9th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $35.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.06. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $35.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $32.94 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $35.46/share today.
Because the $35.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.89% return on the cash commitment, or 49.96% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $35.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $36.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.16. If an investor was to purchase shares of AA stock at the current price level of $35.46/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $36.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.61% if the stock gets called away at the June 9th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $36.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $36.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.09% boost of extra return to the investor, or 51.71% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $35.46) to be 62%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2023-05-05,"What happened
Shares of Arconic (NYSE: ARNC) rocketed this week and were trading up 16","What happened
Shares of Arconic (NYSE: ARNC) rocketed this week and were trading up 16.9% for the week as of 9:40 a.m. ET Friday, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.
The aluminum company, which primarily serves the aerospace and automotive industries, just announced its quarterly numbers, but that has nothing to do with the stock's meteoric rise. The reason behind Arconic's jump is much bigger, and it will affect every investor in the company.
So what
Arconic announced Thursday that it has agreed to be taken private by alternative asset manager Apollo Global Management. As is typically the case, the stock shot up close to the levels at which the deal was struck -- $30 a share. It's an all-cash deal, so every Arconic investor will receive $30 per share in cash when the deal closes, which is expected to be sometime later this year.
Since the deal represented a significant premium to Arconic stock's Wednesday closing price of $22.55 per share, the stock shot up almost 29% by Thursday's closing. It clocked a day's high of $28.93 per share.
Investors in Arconic have seen a lot of volatility in recent years. Arconic was spun off from aluminum giant Alcoa in 2016. Arconic itself then split into two in 2020 and spun off its components and parts businesses into a newly publicly listed company, Howmet Aerospace.
Yet the volatility in commodity prices throttled Arconic's growth, and it struggled to make money. Just this week, Arconic reported a 12% year-over-year drop in sales and a 40% drop in net income for its first quarter. In 2022, Arconic reported a net loss of $182 million, although its revenue rose 19% to $9 billion.
Now what
To be sure, this deal shouldn't have come as a surprise. Arconic has been a potential takeover target for several years now, with Apollo emerging as the front-running suitor. In fact, The Wall Street Journal even reported that Apollo had submitted a buyout offer for Arconic in March of this year.
As it turns out, this time, it was more than just a rumor or speculation, and Arconic is indeed selling itself. Investors who bought Arconic shares in 2020 after it became a stand-alone company have made a lot of money, and this week's gains have only added to their returns.

Shares must be purchased before the ex-div date of May 15, 2023 to qualify for the dividend. Shareholders of record as of May 16, 2023 will receive the payment on June 2, 2023.
At the current share price of $36.15 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 1.11%.
Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 1.61%, the lowest has been 0.43%, and the highest has been 7.05%. The standard deviation of yields is 1.17 (n=237).
The current dividend yield is 0.43 standard deviations below the historical average.
Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is -0.09. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.
The company has not increased its dividend in the last three years.

2023-05-08,"Despite the strong jobs numbers for April, the overall economic outlook heading toward the second ha","Despite the strong jobs numbers for April, the overall economic outlook heading toward the second half of the year remains grim. Against a backdrop of elevated interest rates and recent bank failures, the odds of a recession hitting later this year are up to 64%. It’s an environment almost tailor-made to keep investors nervous – and looking for ‘recession proof’ sectors.
In a recent report from JPMorgan, analyst Bill Peterson sees just such an opening in the aluminum sector. Peterson has taken a deep dive into the complexities of aluminum production and products, and found that the sector presents a number of advantages that should provide long-term support, even in a downturn.
“Aluminum’s light weight and recyclability mean it will play a key role in the transition to a greener economy... J.P. Morgan’s Commodities Research team sees demand for aluminum in EVs, wind, and solar growing from around 2.4Mt in 2020 to 3.8Mt by 2025, reflecting a ~10% CAGR, which we think has significant potential for upside on the accelerated adoption of EVs based on IHS’s forecast of 23% and 45% penetration by 2025 and 2030, respectively,” Peterson explained.
Peterson isn’t just analyzing the aluminum industry as a whole, he’s also putting his finger on two stocks that he sees as winners. In fact, he's projecting more than 40% growth potential for both of them. According to TipRanks, the premier source of analyst insights and research, these stocks also boast significant double-digit upside prospects, as evaluated by other analysts in the field. Here are the details.
Constellium SE (CSTM)
We’ll start with Constellium, a Paris-based global industrial leader, with a strong position in the manufacture of aluminum products. The company also works at the development of new uses for aluminum, and is a leader working with recycled aluminum metal. Constellium is known for its advanced alloys and engineering, and its aluminum products are found in a range of applications, from the simple soda can to aircraft, cars, and packaging.
Constellium does all of this with a truly global footprint. The company employs more than 12,000 people worldwide, and it operates 3 R&D centers and 28 production facilities in Europe, North America, and China. The company serves a wide range of industries, including Aerospace and Transportation (A&T), Packaging and Automotive Rolled Products (P&ARP), and Automotive Structures and Industry (AS&I). Major players in these fields, such as Ford, Audi, Airbus, and Boeing, are among Constellium's esteemed clients.
One number will give the scale of Constellium’s operations, and its presence in the global metals market: 8.1 billion. In Euros, that was the firm’s total revenue in 2022. That number came to more than $8.5 billion in US currency, and marked a 17% increase year-over-year.
The company’s first quarter revenues came to 1.96 billion Euros, or US$2.1 billion; while slightly down 1% yeaer-over-year, this figure beat the forecast by 140 million Euros. At the bottom line, the GAAP EPS was reported as 14 Euro cents, missing the forecast by 22 cents.
Of interest to investors, Constellium generated 34 million Euros in cash from operations in the quarter. The firm’s free cash flow came to a loss of 34 million, due to a 68 million Euro spend on property, plant, and equipment – just the sort of capex expected to bring rewards later on. Management is guiding toward 2023 free cash flow in excess 125 million Euros.
In Peterson’s view, this company’s position in a necessary industrial niche, combined with its potential for cash generation, are the key points. He writes, “Constellium has the most upside potential among our downstream coverage, in our view, as we like its combination of end-market exposure, which can both help weather a recession in aerospace, while also providing strong, long-term growth fundamentals in packaging and auto. Strong FCF generation and pricing power, which have proved resilient through the cycle, are another plus. The slight premium to its ~6x historical average is warranted in our view given its solid FCF generation and improved balance sheet, likely enabling the company to initiate shareholder returns in 1H24.”
The JPMorgan analyst uses these comments to support his Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on the stock, while his US$24 price target implies the stock will gain 55% in the year ahead. (To watch Peterson’s track record, click here)
Overall, this European industrial firm has picked up 5 recent analyst reviews from Wall Street, and those are unanimously positive and give CSTM its Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are selling for $15.46 and have an average price target of $20.40, for a 32% upside potential in the next 12 months. (See CSTM stock forecast)
Alcoa Corporation (AA)
The next stock JPMorgan's Bill Peterson is betting on is Alcoa, a Pittsburgh-based company that has long been a major player on the world’s aluminum scene. Alcoa produces high-end primary aluminum, fabricated aluminum, and alumina products, and markets and distributes them worldwide. The company works with global customers in a wide range of industries, including such commonplaces as home appliances and cookware to cars and bicycles, but also in aerospace and automobiles.
A number of rising economic headwinds have hurt Alcoa in recent months, including a wicked combination of stubborn inflation, elevated interest rates, and disrupted supply chains that work together to push up the cost of production. The company has pushed back, however, by showing that it can ‘turn green,’ tacking with the social and political winds, while still delivering quality products.
Alcoa is doing that by lowering its carbon footprint compared to traditional aluminum producers. The company’s Sustana product lines – in low-carbon aluminum, low-carbon alumina, and recycled aluminum – feature significant improvements in carbon use. The EcoDura line features a minimum of 50% recycled content, while the EcoLum low-carbon aluminum line’s carbon footprint is 3x better than the industry’s average.
Alcoa has achieved this by starting at the base, in the foundries. The company’s proprietary Elysis smelting technology is the first carbon-free smelting tech in the global aluminum industry. Using this tech, Alcoa can smelt aluminum alloys while emitting only oxygen as a gaseous byproduct.
None of this comes cheap. Alcoa’s 1Q23 results showed a top line of $2.67 billion, skating under the forecast by $90 million and declining 19% year-over-year. The bottom line non-GAAP EPS figure was a net loss, at 23 cents per share, instead of breaking even as Wall Street had expected. At the same time, the company did report an important asset – more than $1.1 billion in liquid assets on hand. With those deep pockets, Alcoa is confident that it can meet an economic storm.
What this means for JPM’s Peterson is clear from his comments on the stock: he is bullish here, and isn’t shy about saying so.
“Our view rests on a positive aluminum price outlook , given supply constraints and the commodity’s strong secular growth trends, which can help fund shareholder returns and future growth initiatives. The company has systematically improved its cash funding related to its pension and has no near-term debt obligations, which positions it well for a recessionary slowdown,"" Peterson opined.
""Finally,"" the analyst added, ""we believe Alcoa is also well positioned for aluminum’s growing demand in the energy transition in addition to the 'greening' of the commodity itself with the launch of its low-carbon Sustana product line. The outlook also looks promising for its proprietary, zero-carbon Elysis smelting technology, which eliminates all scope 1 emissions associated with aluminum smelting, instead emitting pure oxygen as a byproduct.”
To this end, Peterson sets an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on Alcoa shares, along with a $54 price target that suggests ~47% share gain by year’s end.
What does the rest of the Street think? Looking at the consensus breakdown, opinions from other analysts are more spread out. 4 Buys, 3 Holds and 1 Sell add up to a Moderate Buy consensus. In addition, the $48.25 average price target indicates a solid 31% upside potential. (See Alcoa stock forecast)

Analyst Price Forecast Suggests 38.96% Upside
As of May 11, 2023, the average one-year price target for Alcoa is 50.22. The forecasts range from a low of 37.37 to a high of $68.25. The average price target represents an increase of 38.96% from its latest reported closing price of 36.14.
See our leaderboard of companies with the largest price target upside.
The projected annual revenue for Alcoa is 12,227MM, an increase of 3.37%. The projected annual non-GAAP EPS is 3.60.
Alcoa Declares $0.10 Dividend
On May 4, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share ($0.40 annualized). Shareholders of record as of May 16, 2023 will receive the payment on June 2, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.10 per share.
At the current share price of $36.14 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 1.11%.
Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 1.62%, the lowest has been 0.43%, and the highest has been 7.05%. The standard deviation of yields is 1.17 (n=237).
The current dividend yield is 0.44 standard deviations below the historical average.
Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is -0.09. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.
The company has not increased its dividend in the last three years.

2023-05-15,"Alcoa to become EGA's largest third-party alumina supplier
The 8-year supply deal will commence in ","Alcoa to become EGA's largest third-party alumina supplier
The 8-year supply deal will commence in 2024
Up to 15.6 mln T of alumina to be supplied from Australia
LONDON, May 15 (Reuters) - U.S. aluminium producer Alcoa Corp AA.N has signed an eight-year agreement to supply another metal producer, Emirates Global Aluminium (EGA), with smelter grade alumina, both companies said in a statement on Monday.
Alumina is the key raw material used for making aluminium. Prices for the metal CMAL3 used in transport, construction and packaging hit their lowest since Oct. 31 last week on concerns about demand from top consumer, China.
Hopes that demand for aluminium would rise in the long-term along with consumption of other metals needed for the global green energy transition are, however, driving appetite for deals in the mining industry.
""Most of our alumina needs into the next decade are now secured by our own production and a long-term supplier in Alcoa,"" EGA's CEO Abdulnasser Bin Kalban said in the statement.
The agreement, which commences in 2024, will allow EGA to procure as much as 15.6 million tonnes of alumina from Western Australia and will represent a significant portion of Alcoa's annual third-party alumina sales, the companies said.
Australia banned exports of alumina to Russia in 2022 after Moscow invaded Ukraine, causing a jump in production costs of Alcoa's and EGA's rival aluminium producer - Russia's Rusal 0486.HK.
The agreement will make Alcoa EGA's largest third-party supplier of alumina, the companies said. EGA operates smelters in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, an alumina refinery in Abu Dhabi, and a bauxite mine in Guinea. Its alumina refinery met 47% of EGA's total alumina needs in 2022.

2023-05-15,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have comp","Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the SPDR MSCI USA StrategicFactors ETF (Symbol: QUS), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $131.46 per unit.
With QUS trading at a recent price near $116.66 per unit, that means that analysts see 12.69% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of QUS's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are CVS Health Corporation (Symbol: CVS), Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA), and Bank of America Corp (Symbol: BAC). Although CVS has traded at a recent price of $68.58/share, the average analyst target is 51.80% higher at $104.11/share. Similarly, AA has 40.10% upside from the recent share price of $35.37 if the average analyst target price of $49.55/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting BAC to reach a target price of $36.58/share, which is 35.02% above the recent price of $27.09. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of CVS, AA, and BAC:
Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
SPDR MSCI USA StrategicFactors ETF QUS $116.66 $131.46 12.69%
CVS Health Corporation CVS $68.58 $104.11 51.80%
Alcoa Corporation AA $35.37 $49.55 40.10%
Bank of America Corp BAC $27.09 $36.58 35.02%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

2023-05-30,"In trading on Tuesday, shares of Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) entered into oversold territory, cha","In trading on Tuesday, shares of Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $32.07 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.
In the case of Alcoa Corporation, the RSI reading has hit 29.2 — by comparison, the universe of metals and mining stocks covered by Metals Channel currently has an average RSI of 37.9, the RSI of Spot Gold is at 6.5, and the RSI of Spot Silver is presently 12.0. A bullish investor could look at AA's 29.2 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.
Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), AA's low point in its 52 week range is $32.07 per share, with $67.52 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $32.43. Alcoa Corporation shares are currently trading off about 3.7% on the day.

2023-06-08,"Investors in Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) saw new options become available today, for the July 28t","Investors in Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) saw new options become available today, for the July 28th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AA options chain for the new July 28th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $35.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.26. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $35.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $32.74 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $35.29/share today.
Because the $35.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.46% return on the cash commitment, or 47.14% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $35.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $36.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.27. If an investor was to purchase shares of AA stock at the current price level of $35.29/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $36.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.44% if the stock gets called away at the July 28th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $36.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $36.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.43% boost of extra return to the investor, or 46.96% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $35.29) to be 59%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2023-06-14,Alcoa (AA) closed at $36,"Alcoa (AA) closed at $36.13 in the latest trading session, marking a -1.55% move from the prior day. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.08%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.68%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.61%.
Heading into today, shares of the bauxite, alumina and aluminum products company had gained 1.66% over the past month, lagging the Industrial Products sector's gain of 8.46% and the S&P 500's gain of 6.1% in that time.
Alcoa will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Alcoa to post earnings of -$0.12 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 104.49%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $2.65 billion, down 27.18% from the prior-year quarter.
For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $0.55 per share and revenue of $10.87 billion, which would represent changes of -88.61% and -12.71%, respectively, from the prior year.
Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Alcoa. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.
Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.
The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 30.38% lower within the past month. Alcoa is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.
Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Alcoa has a Forward P/E ratio of 66.73 right now. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 12.47, which means Alcoa is trading at a premium to the group.
It is also worth noting that AA currently has a PEG ratio of 6.42. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Metal Products - Distribution industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 6.7 as of yesterday's close.
The Metal Products - Distribution industry is part of the Industrial Products sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 116, which puts it in the top 47% of all 250+ industries.
The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.

2023-06-15,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have comp","Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the SPDR S&P MIDCAP 400 ETF Trust ETF (Symbol: MDY), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $533.61 per unit.
With MDY trading at a recent price near $469.68 per unit, that means that analysts see 13.61% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of MDY's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Kemper Corp (Symbol: KMPR), Staar Surgical Co. (Symbol: STAA), and Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA). Although KMPR has traded at a recent price of $44.32/share, the average analyst target is 55.69% higher at $69.00/share. Similarly, STAA has 49.45% upside from the recent share price of $50.48 if the average analyst target price of $75.44/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting AA to reach a target price of $48.67/share, which is 34.70% above the recent price of $36.13. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of KMPR, STAA, and AA:
Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
SPDR S&P MIDCAP 400 ETF Trust ETF MDY $469.68 $533.61 13.61%
Kemper Corp KMPR $44.32 $69.00 55.69%
Staar Surgical Co. STAA $50.48 $75.44 49.45%
Alcoa Corporation AA $36.13 $48.67 34.70%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

Top Warren Buffett Stocks
About Warren Buffett: Warren Buffett is considered by many to be the greatest investor of all time. As the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 for decades, and in the process has become one of the world's richest men. (Forbes puts his net worth at $37 billion.) Despite his fortune, Buffett is known for living a modest lifestyle, by billionaire standards. His primary residence remains the gray stucco Nebraska home he purchased for $31,500 nearly 50 years ago, according to Forbes, and his folksy Midwestern manner and penchant for simple pleasures -- a cherry Coke, a good burger, and a good book are all near the top of the list -- have been well-documented.

2023-06-22,"Investors in Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) saw new options become available today, for the August 4","Investors in Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) saw new options become available today, for the August 4th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AA options chain for the new August 4th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $32.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.58. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $32.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $30.42 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $33.21/share today.
Because the $32.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.94% return on the cash commitment, or 41.91% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $32.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $35.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.50. If an investor was to purchase shares of AA stock at the current price level of $33.21/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $35.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.91% if the stock gets called away at the August 4th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $35.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $35.00 strike represents an approximate 5% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.52% boost of extra return to the investor, or 38.34% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $33.21) to be 59%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2023-07-06,The average one-year price target for Alcoa (NYSE:AA) has been revised to 46,"The average one-year price target for Alcoa (NYSE:AA) has been revised to 46.42 / share. This is an decrease of 7.57% from the prior estimate of 50.22 dated June 1, 2023.
The price target is an average of many targets provided by analysts. The latest targets range from a low of 33.33 to a high of 63.00 / share. The average price target represents an increase of 37.82% from the latest reported closing price of 33.68 / share.
Alcoa Declares $0.10 Dividend
On May 4, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share ($0.40 annualized). Shareholders of record as of May 16, 2023 received the payment on June 2, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.10 per share.
At the current share price of $33.68 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 1.19%.
Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 1.63%, the lowest has been 0.43%, and the highest has been 7.05%. The standard deviation of yields is 1.16 (n=236).
The current dividend yield is 0.38 standard deviations below the historical average.
Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is -0.11. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.
The company has not increased its dividend in the last three years.

There are 1023 funds or institutions reporting positions in Alcoa. This is a decrease of 23 owner(s) or 2.20% in the last quarter.

2023-07-06,"By Andy Home
LONDON, July 6 (Reuters) - European Union (EU) countries have added aluminium to the l","By Andy Home
LONDON, July 6 (Reuters) - European Union (EU) countries have added aluminium to the list of minerals and metals covered by the Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA).
The Act is the centerpiece of the EU's strategy for ensuring it has the necessary inputs to compete with the United States and China in the global race to decarbonise.
The initial omission of aluminium from the CRMA was greeted with outrage from parts of the industry, the Federation of Aluminium Consumers in Europe lambasting EU policy-makers for ""doing the opposite of what should be done"".
The last-minute inclusion of the metal, together with its upstream feeds of bauxite and alumina, attests both to the criticality of aluminium to the green revolution and Europe's increasingly precarious security of supply.
GREEN METAL
Aluminium is already the second most widely used metal in modern society after steel thanks to its high strength-to-weight ratio.
Usage is expected to grow strongly over the coming years as the energy transition gathers pace.
The World Bank has identified aluminium as a ""high-impact"" and ""cross-cutting"" metal in all existing and potential green energy technologies from solar to geothermal.
Moreover, aluminium will play an important role in light-weighting electric vehicles, allowing automakers to get more mileage out of lithium-ion batteries.
Global demand is forecast by the International Aluminium Institute (IAI) to increase by almost 40% to 119.5 million metric tons by 2030, meaning the aluminium sector needs to produce an extra 33.3 million metric tons of metal over the decade.
FALLING OUTPUT
As things stand, Europe is going to struggle to lift primary production at all over that time-frame.
Western European production has been sliding steadily over the last 15 years with run-rates dropping from over 4.5 million metric tons to a current 2.7 million.
The sector has been squeezed between high European energy prices and years of high Chinese exports, largely in the form of semi-fabricated products.
Aluminium smelters consume a lot of power and the sector has taken another hit from the energy crunch that has followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Europe lost another 850,000 tonnes of primary smelter capacity between October 2021 and March 2022, according to the EU.
Some, such as Alcoa's AA.N Spanish plant, will return after new, lower-carbon power supplies are secured. Some may well never return.
IMPORT DEPENDENCY
European aluminium consumption averaged just over 5.0 million metric tons per year over the 2016-2020 period, according to the EU.
Import reliance averaged 56% over the same period, which is much lower than the bloc's 89% import reliance for bauxite and probably the reason why EU planners didn't originally include aluminium in the CRMA.
However, the key difference is where Europe sources its bauxite and primary aluminium.
Imports of bauxite over the 2016-2020 period came primarily from Guinea (70%), Brazil (14%) and Sierra Leone (10%).
Imports of primary aluminium, by contrast, were dominated by Russian metal, which accounted for an average 33% over the same five-year period, according to the EU. The next largest supplier was Mozambique, which accounted for 17% of total imports, followed by Iceland, which accounted for another 14%.
Both the United States and Britain have imposed penal duties on imports of Russian metal but the importance of Russia to Europe's supply chain has meant there are no official European sanctions against Rusal, Russia's dominant producer.
However, the dependence on Russian supply is highly problematic given the increased tensions between the EU and its eastern neighbour after the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
If Russian supply were taken out of the import picture, Europe's aluminium dependence would become much more acute.
POWER PROBLEMS
Getting aluminium onto Europe's critical raw materials list is an important win for the region's aluminium sector.
However, it's just the start.
Preserving what remains of the bloc's primary smelting capacity, let alone rebuilding it, is dependent on low-cost power, something that the EU is running short of right now.
The problem is compounded by aluminium producers' need to lower their carbon footprint. That requires lots of renewable power, something the region is even more short of.
The EU's proposed carbon border adjustment mechanism is another bone of contention. The European aluminium industry fears it will raise the cost of imports while not having any impact on global emissions in an industry dominated by China.
It's worth remembering that European processors are also paying import duties on both primary aluminium and alloy as a result of legacy attempts to protect the region's smelters.
Those import duties have evidently only slowed not halted the steady decline in European smelter production.
TARGETS
The EU's CRMA sets 2030 self-sufficiency targets of 10% of the bloc's consumption for production, 20% for recycling and 50% for processing. The last two have just been raised from 15% and 40% respectively.
In addition, no more than 65% of imports should come from any individual supplier.
If the EU is going to meet all those targets for aluminium, it's going to need a holistic approach that includes affordable green power pricing, a re-think of its legacy import duties and a possible fine-tuning of the proposed carbon border mechanism to reflect the reality of the global aluminium sector.
Putting it on the list of critical raw materials may be the easy part of that multi-dimensional challenge.

Alcoa Declares $0.10 Dividend
On May 4, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share ($0.40 annualized). Shareholders of record as of May 16, 2023 received the payment on June 2, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.10 per share.
At the current share price of $34.69 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 1.15%.
Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 1.63%, the lowest has been 0.43%, and the highest has been 7.05%. The standard deviation of yields is 1.16 (n=236).
The current dividend yield is 0.41 standard deviations below the historical average.
Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is -0.11. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.
The company has not increased its dividend in the last three years.

The company has a dull earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in only two of the preceding four quarters, while missing in the other two. The average miss was 201.6%.

Let’s see how things have shaped up for Alcoa this earnings season.
Alcoa Price and EPS Surprise
Alcoa price-eps-surprise | Alcoa Quote
Factors to Note
Alcoa’s second-quarter performance is likely to have been hurt by lower shipments of alumina and aluminum. Reduced refinery production is expected to have weighed on alumina shipments.

An anticipated weakness in shipments due to lower trading activities and weak volumes from the Canadian smelters is likely to have hurt Aluminum segment’s third-party sales. Higher prices of aluminum and lower raw material and production costs might have partly offset the adversity.

While alumina shipments are likely to reflect softness, higher average realized prices and strong volumes are expected to have driven the segment’s third-party sales. Lower raw material and energy costs are also expected to have aided the unit’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.
What Does the Zacks Model Say?
Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Alcoa this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates, which is not the case here, as elaborated below.

Earnings ESP: Alcoa has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 50 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

Zacks Rank: Alcoa currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.
Highlights of Q1 Earnings
Alcoa incurred an adjusted loss of 23 cents per share in the first quarter of 2023, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 5 cents. In the year-ago period, the company had reported adjusted earnings of $3.06. Total revenues of $2.67 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.31%. The top line declined 18.8% year over year.
Stocks to Consider
Here are some companies you may want to consider from the Zacks Industrial Products sector, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this season:

Stanley Black & Decker SWK has an Earnings ESP of +12.23% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to release second-quarter results on Aug 1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Stanley Black pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 25.3%, on average. The stock has rallied 22.6% in the past three months.

Tenaris TS has an Earnings ESP of +6.27% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is slated to release second-quarter results on Aug 2.

Tenaris delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 9.2%, on average. The stock has gained around 4% in the past three months.

2023-07-12,Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Alcoa (AA) reports r,"Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Alcoa (AA) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.
The earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 19, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.
While management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings callwill mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This bauxite, alumina and aluminum products company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.50 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -118.7%.
Revenues are expected to be $2.62 billion, down 28.1% from the year-ago quarter.
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 64.84% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.
Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Alcoa?
For Alcoa, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.
On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.
So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Alcoa will beat the consensus EPS estimate.
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.
For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Alcoa would post a loss of $0.05 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.23, delivering a surprise of -360%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.
That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.
Alcoa doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

2023-07-12,Alcoa (NYSE:AA) is expected to publish its Q2 2023 results on July 19 reporting on a quarter that sa,"Alcoa (NYSE:AA) is expected to publish its Q2 2023 results on July 19 reporting on a quarter that saw aluminum prices trend lower. We expect the company’s revenues to come in at about $2.72 billion, marginally ahead of the consensus estimates. While this would be roughly flat on a sequential basis, it would translate into a year-over-year decline of around 17%. We estimate that the company will post a net loss of about -$0.30 per share, roughly in line with the consensus, although this would mark a sharp decline from last year. So what are some of the trends that are likely to drive Alcoa’s results? See our interactive dashboard analysis on Alcoa Earnings Preview for more details on how AA’s revenues and earnings are likely to trend for the quarter.
Aluminum prices have been on the decline over the past few months, amid improving supply trends, particularly in China, driven by more relaxed power restrictions and new capacity coming online. Moreover, reports of the resumption of smelting operations in China’s Yunnan province in late June have also been weighing on the aluminum market. While aluminum prices stood at about $2,400 in early April, they have declined since then to about $2,150 per ton currently. This is likely to impact the company’s revenues for the quarter. Separately, Alcoa has seen some delays in getting approvals for bauxite mining in Australia and this has resulted in the company mining for lower bauxite grades from previously approved areas. This could also impact results to an extent. That said, things could pick up a bit in Europe. While Alcoa was facing headwinds due to the high price of natural gas, this is likely to have moderated a bit over the last two months as energy prices cooled. Although Alcoa has not provided specific guidance for Q2 2023, it expects to ship between 2.5 and 2.6 million metric tons of aluminum in 2023, consistent with 2022.
Overall, we still remain positive on AA stock despite expectations of mixed results. Alcoa stock remains down almost 25% year-to-date and this could be a compelling entry point. Rising investments in the renewable energy sector including electric vehicles, charging infrastructure, and solar and wind power plants remain secular drivers for aluminum demand. We think that Alcoa has an edge over other aluminum producers given its strong balance sheet  and also due to the fact that its facilities are largely based in the U.S., resulting in lower energy costs compared to European rivals. We value AA stock at $48 per share, which is well ahead of the current market price of about $34. See our analysis of Alcoa valuation for a closer look at what’s driving our price estimate for Alcoa and how Alcoa’s valuation compares with peers. Also, see our analysis of Alcoa Revenue for more details on how Alcoa’s revenues are expected to trend.

2023-07-13,"Investors in Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) saw new options begin trading today, for the September 1","Investors in Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) saw new options begin trading today, for the September 1st expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AA options chain for the new September 1st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $36.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.99. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $36.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $34.01 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $37.04/share today.
Because the $36.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.53% return on the cash commitment, or 40.35% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $36.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $38.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.23. If an investor was to purchase shares of AA stock at the current price level of $37.04/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $38.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.61% if the stock gets called away at the September 1st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $38.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $38.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.02% boost of extra return to the investor, or 43.95% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $37.04) to be 58%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

September E-Mini S&P 500 futures (ESU23) this morning are up +0","Morning Markets
September E-Mini S&P 500 futures (ESU23) this morning are up +0.17% at a 15-month high, and Sep Nasdaq 100 E-Mini futures (NQU23) are up +0.06%.
U.S. stock index futures this morning are moving higher as Q2 corporate earnings results begin to roll in. Strength in bank earnings is supporting the overall market as JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup are moving higher in pre-market trading on better-than-expected Q2 earnings.  However, gains are muted as bond yields move higher on hawkish comments late Thursday from Fed Governor Waller, who said he sees two more +25 bp rate hikes this year.
Late Thursday, Fed Governor Waller said, ""I see two more 25 bp interest rate hikes in the target range over the four remaining FOMC meetings this year as necessary to keep inflation moving toward our target.""
Positive inflation news is also bullish for stocks after the U.S. Jun import price index ex-petroleum fell -0.3% m/m, a slightly larger decline than expectations of -0.2% m/m.
While this week’s better-than-expected inflation and price reports are unlikely to dissuade the Fed from raising interest rates by 25 bp later this month, it increases the chances that this month’s rate hike could be the last rate hike in this cycle. 
The markets are discounting the odds at 91% for a +25 bp rate hike at the next FOMC meeting on July 25-26.  The markets are anticipating a peak funds rate of 5.42% by November, which is +34 bp higher than the current effective federal funds rate of 5.08%.
Global bond yields are mixed.  The 10-year T-note yield is up +1.6 bp at 3.779%.  The 10-year German bund yield is up +0.2 bp at 2.487%.  The 10-year UK Gilt yield fell to a 1-1/2 week low of 4.371% and is down -2.7 bp at 4.394%.  
Overseas stock markets are mixed.  The Euro Stoxx 50 is up +0.36%.  China’s Shanghai Composite Index today closed up +0.04%.  Japan’s Nikkei Stock Index today closed down -0.09%.
The Euro Stoxx 50 today is moderately higher.  European stocks have support today from favorable inflation news after the German Jun wholesale price index posted its largest decline in 3 years. However, stock gains were limited by weakness in telecom companies, as Nokia Oyj and Ericsson AB both fell more than -8% after issuing disappointing guidance because of weaker demand.  Also, retailer stocks were weaker after Burberry Group Plc reported Q1 retail comparable sales rose +18%, slightly below expectations of +18.3%, as Q1 China comparable store sales rose less than expected. 
The German Jun wholesale price index fell -2.9% y/y, the largest decline in 3 years.
China’s Shanghai Composite today climbed to a 3-1/2 week high and closed slightly higher.  Strength in Chinese stocks related to artificial intelligence led the overall market higher after the government loosened some of the regulations it proposed for ChatGPT-style services, signaling the need for companies to compete for global leadership in artificial intelligence.  The new 24 guidelines will be overseen by seven state agencies led by the Cyberspace Administration of China.  Stocks also found support after China’s central bank signaled more policy support for the economy. 
Top officials of the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said they have enough room to ease monetary policy if needed.  PBOC Deputy Governor Liu Guoqiang said, ""We still have ample policy room to deal with unexpected challenges and changes.""  Also, Zou Lan, head of the monetary policy department, said the PBOC will take policy steps on ""the needs of the economy and the price situation.""
Japan’s Nikkei Stock Index today fell back from a 1-week high and closed slightly lower.  Stocks came under pressure from economic concerns after Japan's May industrial production was revised lower.  Also, strength in the yen weighed on exporter stocks after the yen rallied to a 1-3/4 month high against the dollar.  Speculation that the BOJ may signal a policy change or tweak its yield curve control framework at its July 27-28 meeting has pushed government bond yields higher and boosted the yen.  The 10-year JGB bond yield climbed to a 2-1/2 month high today at 0.485%.  The Nikkei Stock Index today initially moved higher on strength in Japanese chip equipment and material suppliers after Nvidia rallied to a new record high Thursday on optimism about AI-related growth.
Japan's May industrial production was revised lower to -2.2% m/m from the initially reported -1.6% m/m, the largest decline in 4 months.
Pre-Market U.S. Stock Movers
JPMorgan Chase (JPM) climbed more than +2% in pre-market trading after reporting Q2 adjusted revenue of $42.40 billion, well above the consensus of $39.34 billion, and raised its full-year net interest income excluding CIB markets estimate to $87 billion from a prior estimate of $84 billion.

Stocks today extended this week’s rally, with the S&P 500 at a 15-month high, the Dow Jones Industrials at a 7-month high, and the Nasdaq 100 at a 1-1/2 year high.  Stocks are moving higher as Q2 corporate earnings results begin to roll in. Strength in bank earnings is supporting the overall market as JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup reported better-than-expected Q2 earnings.  Stock indexes jumped to their highs after the University of Michigan U.S. July consumer sentiment index rose more than expected to a 1-3/4 year high.
On the negative side was a hawkish comment Thursday night from Fed Governor Waller, who said he sees two more +25 bp rate hikes this year. Also, an increase in inflation expectations pushed bond yields higher and is negative for stocks after the University of Michigan U.S. July inflation expectations indicator unexpectedly rose.

Positive inflation news is bullish for stocks after the U.S. Jun import price index ex-petroleum fell -0.3% m/m, a slightly larger decline than expectations of -0.2% m/m.
The markets are discounting the odds at 92% for a +25 bp rate hike at the next FOMC meeting on July 25-26.  The markets are anticipating a peak funds rate of 5.42% by November, which is +34 bp higher than the current effective federal funds rate of 5.08%.

2023-07-17,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have comp","Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (Symbol: XME), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $60.85 per unit.
With XME trading at a recent price near $51.56 per unit, that means that analysts see 18.01% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of XME's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Uranium Energy Corp (Symbol: UEC), Peabody Energy Corp (Symbol: BTU), and Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA). Although UEC has traded at a recent price of $3.12/share, the average analyst target is 117.15% higher at $6.78/share. Similarly, BTU has 39.02% upside from the recent share price of $20.86 if the average analyst target price of $29.00/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting AA to reach a target price of $43.30/share, which is 25.43% above the recent price of $34.52. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of UEC, BTU, and AA:
Combined, UEC, BTU, and AA represent 10.00% of the SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF. Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF XME $51.56 $60.85 18.01%
Uranium Energy Corp UEC $3.12 $6.78 117.15%
Peabody Energy Corp BTU $20.86 $29.00 39.02%
Alcoa Corporation AA $34.52 $43.30 25.43%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

2023-07-19,Alcoa (AA) came out with a quarterly loss of $0,"Alcoa (AA) came out with a quarterly loss of $0.35 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.59. This compares to earnings of $2.67 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 40.68%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this bauxite, alumina and aluminum products company would post a loss of $0.05 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.23, delivering a surprise of -360%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.
Alcoa, which belongs to the Zacks Metal Products - Distribution industry, posted revenues of $2.68 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.16%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.64 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.
The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.
Alcoa shares have lost about 22.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 18.6%.
What's Next for Alcoa?
While Alcoa has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?
There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.
Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Alcoa: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.16 on $2.63 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and -$0.38 on $10.64 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Metal Products - Distribution is currently in the top 50% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
Reliance Steel (RS), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2023. The results are expected to be released on July 27.
This metals service-center company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $6.52 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -28.7%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6.1% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.
Reliance Steel's revenues are expected to be $3.96 billion, down 15.4% from the year-ago quarter.

Alcoa Declares $0.10 Dividend
On May 4, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share ($0.40 annualized). Shareholders of record as of May 16, 2023 received the payment on June 2, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.10 per share.
At the current share price of $32.68 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 1.22%.
Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 1.63%, the lowest has been 0.43%, and the highest has been 7.05%. The standard deviation of yields is 1.16 (n=236).
The current dividend yield is 0.35 standard deviations below the historical average.
Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is -0.06. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.
The company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is -0.20%.

Alcoa Declares $0.10 Dividend
On May 4, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share ($0.40 annualized). Shareholders of record as of May 16, 2023 received the payment on June 2, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.10 per share.
At the current share price of $32.68 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 1.22%.
Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 1.63%, the lowest has been 0.43%, and the highest has been 7.05%. The standard deviation of yields is 1.16 (n=236).
The current dividend yield is 0.35 standard deviations below the historical average.
Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is -0.06. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.
The company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is -0.20%.

2023-08-03,"By Andy Home
LONDON, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Rio Tinto RIO","By Andy Home
LONDON, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Rio Tinto RIO.L is finding out just how hard it is to produce low-carbon aluminium.
The company booked a $1.175 billion impairment charge against its two Australian alumina refineries in its second-quarter results.
This is in part down to what Rio Tinto called ""challenging market conditions"" for alumina, which is refined from bauxite and then fed into a smelter for conversion into metal.
But it is also down to the cost of decarbonising two of the company's biggest greenhouse gas emitters.
The short-term cost comes in the form of Australia's new carbon tax on big industrial operators.
The long-term problem is the dependence of both Rio's alumina refineries and aluminium smelters on a national power grid that is largely driven by coal and gas.
Such is the aluminium paradox. A metal that is core to the green energy transition comes with a heavy carbon footprint, the sector accounting for around 2% of all man-made emissions every year.
CARBON PROBLEMS
Rio Tinto has conceded it is unlikely to meet its 15% target for reducing group emissions by 2025 without buying carbon credits, although it remains committed to its goal of cutting emissions in half by 2030.
The company's biggest carbon headache is its aluminium business, which last year accounted for 21.1 million metric tons of carbon emissions out of a group total of 30.3 million metric tons.
Rio's Canadian smelter network draws power from Quebec's hydro-electric system, meaning its Atlantic operations generated 4.8 million metric tons of carbon equivalent last year, half the amount produced by its Pacific operations, according to Rio's 2022 sustainability report.
The two Pacific region refineries, Queensland Aluminium (QAL) and Yarwun, with combined alumina production last year of 6.4 million metric tons, are responsible for half of Rio's Scope 1 direct emissions in Australia.
Together with the company's three power-hungry smelters, the Australian operations represent around half of the group's direct and Scope 2 emissions, which include the carbon footprint of energy used in the aluminium production process.
WRITE-DOWNS
Rio's impairment charge, which comes in at $828 million after tax, comprises a complete write-down of the Yarwun refinery and a $227 million impairment of the QAL plant.
The company is evaluating a major capital investment project at QAL aimed at boosting efficiency and cutting emissions. If the so-called ""double digestion"" project doesn't go ahead, the operation will also be fully written down, Rio said.
The trigger for the write-down is the Australian government's revised Safeguard Mechanism, which came into force in July. It sets carbon caps on some of the country's biggest emitters, forcing them to pay for carbon offsets if they breach the upper threshold.
That imposes extra costs on a business in which ""we're actually not really making money"", Rio Tinto CEO Jakob Stausholm told analysts on the company's quarterly results call.
The baseline for calculating the carbon caps will decline by 4.9% each year until 2030, which the government hopes will allow companies time to decarbonise their operations.
Rio has won some concessions from the government on the basis that its aluminium assets are a strategic part of the country's industrial profile, but its two refineries have still not escaped the negative financial impact.
GRID-LOCK
As well as looking at an upgrade at QAL, Rio has partnered with Japan's Sumitomo Corp on a project to use hydrogen rather than natural gas at Yarwun.
The pilot plant will produce around 6,000 metric tons of alumina per year while cutting carbon dioxide emissions by about 3,000 metric tons per year.
This, however, is experimental technology and doesn't provide an immediate solution to the bigger problem of decarbonising Australia's grid.
The country's six alumina refineries were 93% dependent on coal or gas power in 2021, according to the International Aluminium Institute.
Rio's three smelters and the Portland plant, majority owned by U.S. producer Alcoa AA.N, are equally tied to fossil fuel power.
The scale of converting the existing grid to renewable energy is daunting.
Switching Rio's operations to wind or solar would mean building a renewable energy park 12 times larger than anything so far constructed in Australia, according to Stausholm.
""So it's not something you just solve from one day to another,"" he told analysts.
LONG-TERM THREAT
Rio is pursuing multiple paths towards greener aluminium in its North American operations.
It has partnered with Alcoa on producing aluminium using inert cathode technology, which will reduce Scope 1 emissions in the smelting process.
Construction of the first commercial-scale prototype cells has begun at the company's Alma smelter in Canada with operations due to begin this year.
Capacity at the low-carbon AP60 smelter, also in Quebec, will be expanded by 160,000 metric tons per year, with commissioning expected in 2026.
Rio is investing heavily in recycled aluminium, which can be remelted using just 5% of the power needed to produce virgin metal.
The company has just announced a joint venture with Giampaolo Group, one of North America's largest secondary aluminium operators, with the capacity to produce 900,000 metric tons a year of recycled metal.
But its Australian operations are going to remain a significant brake on the company's journey towards a lower carbon future.
Rio views the business as ""critical"" to its wider portfolio, according to Peter Cunningham, the company's chief financial officer.
It is also critical to Australia, not just because of its size but because, as Stausholm pointed out, it is ""a business that can underwrite a lot of renewable energy"".
""But if we can't get firm renewable energy at a competitive price, it's going to be impossible for us to manufacture and export aluminium out of Australia,"" he warned.
Rio's predicament neatly encapsulates the power paradox facing aluminium producers everywhere. Going green needs green energy, and there's not enough of it around right now.

2023-08-03,The average one-year price target for Alcoa (NYSE:AA) has been revised to 39,"The average one-year price target for Alcoa (NYSE:AA) has been revised to 39.86 / share. This is an decrease of 14.12% from the prior estimate of 46.42 dated July 5, 2023.
The price target is an average of many targets provided by analysts. The latest targets range from a low of 25.25 to a high of 57.75 / share. The average price target represents an increase of 10.15% from the latest reported closing price of 36.19 / share.
Alcoa Declares $0.10 Dividend
On May 4, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share ($0.40 annualized). Shareholders of record as of May 16, 2023 received the payment on June 2, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.10 per share.
At the current share price of $36.19 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 1.11%.
Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 1.64%, the lowest has been 0.43%, and the highest has been 7.05%. The standard deviation of yields is 1.16 (n=236).
The current dividend yield is 0.46 standard deviations below the historical average.
Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is -0.06. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.
The company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is -0.20%.

2023-08-03,"Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, on 8/7/23, National Instruments Corp","Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, on 8/7/23, National Instruments Corp. (Symbol: NATI), Kennametal Inc. (Symbol: KMT), and Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends. National Instruments Corp. will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.28 on 8/29/23, Kennametal Inc. will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.20 on 8/22/23, and Alcoa Corporation will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.10 on 8/24/23. As a percentage of NATI's recent stock price of $59.10, this dividend works out to approximately 0.47%, so look for shares of National Instruments Corp. to trade 0.47% lower — all else being equal — when NATI shares open for trading on 8/7/23. Similarly, investors should look for KMT to open 0.71% lower in price and for AA to open 0.29% lower, all else being equal.
Below are dividend history charts for NATI, KMT, and AA, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared.
National Instruments Corp. (Symbol: NATI):
Kennametal Inc. (Symbol: KMT):
Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA):
In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 1.90% for National Instruments Corp., 2.86% for Kennametal Inc., and 1.18% for Alcoa Corporation.
In Thursday trading, National Instruments Corp. shares are currently up about 0.1%, Kennametal Inc. shares are off about 2.7%, and Alcoa Corporation shares are up about 0.1% on the day.

2023-08-22,"In trading on Tuesday, shares of Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) entered into oversold territory, cha","In trading on Tuesday, shares of Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $28.33 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.
In the case of Alcoa Corporation, the RSI reading has hit 29.9 — by comparison, the universe of metals and mining stocks covered by Metals Channel currently has an average RSI of 44.1, the RSI of Spot Gold is at 5.4, and the RSI of Spot Silver is presently 17.1. A bullish investor could look at AA's 29.9 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.
Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), AA's low point in its 52 week range is $28.03 per share, with $58.235 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $28.39. Alcoa Corporation shares are currently trading off about 0.7% on the day.

2023-08-24,"Investors in Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) saw new options begin trading today, for the October 6th","Investors in Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) saw new options begin trading today, for the October 6th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AA options chain for the new October 6th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $28.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.37. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $28.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $26.63 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $28.83/share today.
Because the $28.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.89% return on the cash commitment, or 41.53% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $28.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $29.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.89. If an investor was to purchase shares of AA stock at the current price level of $28.83/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $29.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.15% if the stock gets called away at the October 6th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $29.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $29.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.56% boost of extra return to the investor, or 55.65% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $28.83) to be 57%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Alcoa Declares $0.10 Dividend
On July 27, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share ($0.40 annualized). Shareholders of record as of August 8, 2023 received the payment on August 24, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.10 per share.
At the current share price of $28.48 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 1.40%.
Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 1.65%, the lowest has been 0.43%, and the highest has been 7.05%. The standard deviation of yields is 1.16 (n=236).
The current dividend yield is 0.21 standard deviations below the historical average.
Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is -0.06. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.
The company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is -0.20%.

2023-09-07,"Investors in Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) saw new options begin trading today, for the October 27t","Investors in Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) saw new options begin trading today, for the October 27th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AA options chain for the new October 27th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $26.00 strike price has a current bid of 97 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $26.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $25.03 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $28.21/share today.
Because the $26.00 strike represents an approximate 8% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.73% return on the cash commitment, or 27.23% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $26.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $30.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.31. If an investor was to purchase shares of AA stock at the current price level of $28.21/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $30.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 10.99% if the stock gets called away at the October 27th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $30.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $30.00 strike represents an approximate 6% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.64% boost of extra return to the investor, or 33.90% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $28.21) to be 57%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2023-09-12,This year has not been a good one for aluminum prices (ALU23),"This year has not been a good one for aluminum prices (ALU23). The aluminum futures benchmark on the London Metal Exchange has fallen nearly a fifth since its January peak, and more than 40% from last year’s highs — largely due to economic weakness in Europe and the U.S., and poor construction demand in China.
The benchmark three-month future contract on the LME is currently about $2,180 a metric ton, down from more than $3,840 a ton at last year’s peak.
This slump in aluminum prices this year is reflecting the long-awaited, but yet-to-materialize global economic slowdown. Used in everything from buildings, beverage cans, solar panels, automobiles and airplanes, aluminum prices are often a proxy for expected industrial activity.
With aluminum trading at levels last seen in early 2021, it may be “nearing a bottom,” according to producers and industry analysts, who are growing increasingly bullish about demand over the medium term for the metal from quickly growing clean technologies. These technologies include electric vehicles (EVs) and solar panels.
Demand from the solar market is particularly strong at the moment. Solar farms typically use aluminum for frames and mounting solar panels. Electric vehicles also require more aluminum than traditional internal combustion engine cars.
The Aluminum Market Now
Aluminum prices this month experienced their largest contango since the 2008-09 global financial crisis. Contango means that aluminum bought currently is at a discount to the futures prices for aluminum. This reflects weak spot (immediate) demand, as well as the expectation that future prices will be higher than today.
Estimates are that there is currently  a global surplus of just over 800,000 metric tons this year, and that is weighing on the price.
But there are also signs that the gloomy fog over aluminum is beginning to lift, as a period of running down global aluminum inventories appears to be coming to an end.Surprisingly to some, China has actually been a bright spot for aluminum demand. That’s due to the fact that rapidly growing spending on clean energy infrastructure is more than making up for slumping demand from the highly indebted Chinese property sector.
Graeme Train, head of metals research at trading house Trafigura (one of the world’s largest metals traders), told the Financial Times that “Chinese demand is running at a record high.”
In July, China’s imports of aluminum rose 20% compared with a year earlier. However, that positive is being partially offset by China’s domestic production of aluminum, which is close to a record high.
Add up all the factors, and the outlook for aluminum looks much more interesting - over the medium term - than it has been for a long time.
One way to participate in aluminum’s upside potential is by purchasing Alcoa (AA) stock. Let’s take a closer look at the company.
Alcoa Outlook
Alcoa, founded in 1888, is one of the world’s largest aluminum producers. It is a vertically integrated aluminum company that is comprised of bauxite mining, alumina refining, aluminum production (smelting and casting), and energy generation. The company has 27 operating locations (through direct and indirect ownership) in 9 countries on 6 continents, situated primarily in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Iceland, Norway, Spain, and the U.S. 
Alcoa's assets include the largest bauxite mining portfolio in the world, a globally-diverse alumina refining system, and an aluminum smelting portfolio. The company is one of the world’s largest bauxite miners, with access to large bauxite deposit areas with mining rights that extend (in most cases) more than 20 years. Alcoa has ownership in seven active bauxite mines globally, four of which it operates, that are strategically located near key Atlantic and Pacific markets. This includes the Huntly mine in Australia, which the second largest bauxite mine in the world.
Alcoa is also the world’s largest alumina producer outside of China, with a highly competitive cost curve position. It has seven refineries on four continents, including one of the world’s largest alumina production facilities, the Pinjarra refinery in Western Australia. In addition to supplying its aluminum smelters with high-quality feedstock, AA also has significant alumina sales to third parties, with around two thirds of production being sold externally.
Alcoa’s stock is down 45% over the past year and 37.6% year-to-date. The shares have sold off over lower aluminum prices and the related fears of a steep global recession, and now trade just over $28.
www.barchart.com
Even if Alcoa stock goes back to $35 a share, it would imply an EV/EBITDA (enterprise value/earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ratio) of 4.8 times its 2024 EBITDA estimate. That’s in line with its three-year average forward EV/EBITDA - but a discount to its peers, which trade at an average of 7.5 times.
Given Alcoa’s compelling valuation and strong free cash flow yield, I am confident in the company, as it is increasingly relied upon to meet the growing structural demand from electrification and the global energy transition.
AA can be bought anywhere below $30 a share.

2023-09-18,Earnings are arguably the most important single number on a company's quarterly financial report,"Earnings are arguably the most important single number on a company's quarterly financial report. Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.
We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.
Hunting for 'earnings whispers' or companies poised to beat their quarterly earnings estimates is a somewhat common practice. But that doesn't make it easy. One way that has been proven to work is by using the Zacks Earnings ESP tool.
The Zacks Earnings ESP, Explained
The Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate.
With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure. The system also utilizes our core Zacks Rank to provide a stronger system for identifying stocks that might beat their next quarterly earnings estimate and possibly see the stock price climb.
Bringing together a positive earnings ESP alongside a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better has helped stocks report a positive earnings surprise 70% of the time. Furthermore, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
Most stocks, about 60%, fall into the #3 (Hold) category, and they are expected to perform in-line with the broader market. Stocks with a #2 (Buy) and #1 (Strong Buy) rating, or the top 15% and top 5% of stocks, respectively, should outperform the market, with Strong Buy stocks outperforming more than any other rank.
Should You Consider Alcoa?
Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Alcoa (AA) earns a #3 (Hold) right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at -$0.79 a share, just 30 days from its upcoming earnings release on October 18, 2023.
Alcoa's Earnings ESP sits at +4.05%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the -$0.79 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of -$0.82. AA is also part of a large group of stocks that boast a positive ESP. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.
AA is part of a big group of Industrial Products stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Rockwell Automation (ROK) as well.
Rockwell Automation is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on November 1, 2023. ROK's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $3.54 a share 44 days from its next earnings release.
Rockwell Automation's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at +1.4% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.49.
AA and ROK's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.

2023-09-28,"Investors in Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) saw new options become available today, for the November","Investors in Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) saw new options become available today, for the November 10th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AA options chain for the new November 10th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $26.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.25. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $26.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $24.75 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $27.60/share today.
Because the $26.00 strike represents an approximate 6% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.81% return on the cash commitment, or 40.77% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $26.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $28.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.82. If an investor was to purchase shares of AA stock at the current price level of $27.60/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $28.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.04% if the stock gets called away at the November 10th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $28.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $28.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.59% boost of extra return to the investor, or 55.92% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $27.60) to be 55%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Alcoa Declares $0.10 Dividend
On July 27, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share ($0.40 annualized). Shareholders of record as of August 8, 2023 received the payment on August 24, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.10 per share.
At the current share price of $27.16 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 1.47%.
Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 1.66%, the lowest has been 0.43%, and the highest has been 7.05%. The standard deviation of yields is 1.15 (n=236).
The current dividend yield is 0.17 standard deviations below the historical average.
Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is -0.06. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.
The company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is -0.20%.

2023-10-11,The market expects Alcoa (AA) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when,"The market expects Alcoa (AA) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.
The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 18, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.
While management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings callwill mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This bauxite, alumina and aluminum products company is expected to post quarterly loss of $1.04 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -215.2%.
Revenues are expected to be $2.59 billion, down 9% from the year-ago quarter.
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 9.62% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.
Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Alcoa?
For Alcoa, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -5.29%.
On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.
So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Alcoa will beat the consensus EPS estimate.
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.
For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Alcoa would post a loss of $0.59 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.35, delivering a surprise of +40.68%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.
That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.
Alcoa doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

2023-10-11,"Alcoa (NYSE:AA) is expected to publish its Q3 2023 results around October 18, reporting on a quarter","Alcoa (NYSE:AA) is expected to publish its Q3 2023 results around October 18, reporting on a quarter that saw aluminum prices trend lower. We expect the company’s revenues to come in at about $2.63 billion, marginally ahead of the consensus estimates of $2.59 billion. While this would mark a 2% decline sequentially, it would translate into a year-over-year decline of around 12%. We estimate that the company will post a net loss of about -$0.90 per share, slightly better than the consensus, although this would mark a decline from last year. So what are some of the trends that are likely to drive Alcoa’s results? See our interactive dashboard analysis on Alcoa Earnings Preview for more details on how AA’s revenues and earnings are likely to trend for the quarter.
We note that AA stock has had a Sharpe Ratio of 0.2 since early 2017, which is lower than 0.5 for the S&P 500 Index over the same period. This compares with the Sharpe of 1.2 for the Trefis Reinforced Value portfolio. Sharpe is a measure of return per unit of risk, and high-performance portfolios can provide the best of both worlds.
Aluminum prices have been weak over the last few months, amid improving supply trends, particularly in China, driven by more relaxed power restrictions and new capacity coming online. Moreover, there have been concerns about the real estate market in China, leading to slower demand from the construction sector. That said, the country could be seeing higher investment in the electrical grid and vehicle production. Moreover, orders from the automotive market, particularly in Europe and North America, are likely strong as the semiconductor shortage eased, helping production. While aluminum prices stood at about $2,400 in early April, they have declined since then to about $2,200 per ton currently. This is likely to impact the company’s revenues for the quarter. Separately, Alcoa has seen some delays in getting approvals for bauxite mining in Australia and this has resulted in the company mining for lower bauxite grades from previously approved areas as of Q2. This could also impact results to an extent, as production costs for these grades will be higher. However, the company could see production costs ease a bit for alumina and aluminum as prices for certain inputs such as caustic soda, and calcined petroleum coke ease.
Overall, we still remain positive on AA stock despite the year-over-year decline in the company’s performance. Alcoa stock remains down almost 40% year-to-date and this could be a compelling entry point. Rising investments in the renewable energy sector including electric vehicles, charging infrastructure, and solar and wind power plants remain secular drivers for aluminum demand. We think that Alcoa has an edge over other aluminum producers given its strong balance sheet and also due to the fact that its facilities are based mainly in the U.S., resulting in lower energy costs compared to European rivals. We value AA stock at $39 per share, which is well ahead of the current market price of about $29. See our analysis of Alcoa valuation for a closer look at what’s driving our price estimate for Alcoa and how Alcoa’s valuation compares with peers. Also, see our analysis of Alcoa Revenue for more details on how Alcoa’s revenues are expected to trend.

2023-10-12,"Investors in Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) saw new options become available today, for the December","Investors in Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) saw new options become available today, for the December 1st expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AA options chain for the new December 1st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $27.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.90. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $27.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $25.10 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $27.20/share today.
Because the $27.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.04% return on the cash commitment, or 51.33% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $27.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $28.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.73. If an investor was to purchase shares of AA stock at the current price level of $27.20/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $28.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.30% if the stock gets called away at the December 1st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $28.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $28.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.36% boost of extra return to the investor, or 46.39% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $27.20) to be 53%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2023-10-13,It’s the unofficial start to Q3 earnings season with the morning releases of some of the biggest ban,"It’s the unofficial start to Q3 earnings season with the morning releases of some of the biggest banks on Wall Street. In truth, we’ve been seeing Q3 reports come in dribs and drabs previously this week and before. Traditionally, earnings season didn’t kick off until Alcoa (AA) reported, but they’re not scheduled until next Wednesday. In any case, we’re happy we’re here; we can finally get a good glimpse at how the past quarter went, and how the full year is expected to finish.
Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated JPMorgan Chase (JPM) posted Q3 earnings of $4.33 per share, nicely surpassing the $3.89 in the Zacks consensus for an +11.3% positive earnings surprise — and its fifth-straight bottom-line beat. Revenues of $39.87 billion in the quarter outperformed expectations by +1.9%, helping solidify its leadership status of the biggest Wall Street banks.
Citigroup (C) also beat estimates on both top and bottom lines this morning for its Q3, with earnings of $1.63 per share coming in ahead of the $1.26 analysts were looking for on $20.4 billion in quarterly revenues, which surpassed the $19.32 billion anticipated. Both Institutional and Wealth Management outperformed expectations in the quarter, and shares are up +2.6% on the news.
Wells Fargo (WFC) made it a trifecta this morning, outpacing expectations on both earnings and revenues. The company reported $1.39 per share — nicely above the $1.25 Zacks consensus and the $1.30 per share posted in the previous year’s quarter. Revenues of $20.86 billion in the quarter beat estimates by a cool +3.18%. Shares are up +2.4% in pre-market trading at this hour, nearly bring shares back to break-even for the year.]
The September Import Price Index this morning came in well below expectations: +0.1% versus +0.5% consensus, which was also the previous month’s print. It’s the smallest move on import prices since June. Stripping out volatile petrol (fuel oil/gasoline), this figure drops to -0.3% — lower than the -0.1% anticipated and the lowest result since June of 2022. Year over year came in -1.7% for the eighth straight down-month. It’s worse than the -1.4% expected, but the closest to break-even since February.
Exports came in +0.7% month over month. Its -4.1% year over year is pretty much in-line with analyst expectations, and an improvement from the downwardly revised -5.7% the previous month. This is the sixth-straight month lower on export prices, year over year. After today’s open, we’ll see Consumer Sentiment for October, expected to tick down to 67.4 from 68.1 reported last month.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -0.89%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this bauxite, alumina and aluminum products company would post a loss of $0.59 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.35, delivering a surprise of 40.68%.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.85 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.
The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.
Alcoa shares have lost about 38.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 13.9%.
What's Next for Alcoa?
While Alcoa has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?
There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.
Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Alcoa: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.29 on $2.7 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and -$1.79 on $10.68 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Metal Products - Distribution is currently in the top 22% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Alcoa Declares $0.10 Dividend
On July 27, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share ($0.40 annualized). Shareholders of record as of August 8, 2023 received the payment on August 24, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.10 per share.
At the current share price of $24.23 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 1.65%.
Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 1.67%, the lowest has been 0.43%, and the highest has been 7.05%. The standard deviation of yields is 1.15 (n=236).
The current dividend yield is 0.02 standard deviations below the historical average.
Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is -0.08. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.
The company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is -0.20%.
What is the Fund Sentiment?
There are 886 funds or institutions reporting positions in Alcoa. This is a decrease of 128 owner(s) or 12.62% in the last quarter. Average portfolio weight of all funds dedicated to AA is 0.17%, a decrease of 25.19%. Total shares owned by institutions decreased in the last three months by 2.69% to 165,267K shares.

Alcoa Declares $0.10 Dividend
On July 27, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share ($0.40 annualized). Shareholders of record as of August 8, 2023 received the payment on August 24, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.10 per share.
At the current share price of $24.23 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 1.65%.
Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 1.67%, the lowest has been 0.43%, and the highest has been 7.05%. The standard deviation of yields is 1.15 (n=236).
The current dividend yield is 0.02 standard deviations below the historical average.
Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is -0.08. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.
The company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is -0.20%.

(Symbol: OHI), Texas Instruments Inc. (Symbol: TXN), and Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends. Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc. will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.67 on 11/15/23, Texas Instruments Inc. will pay its quarterly dividend of $1.30 on 11/14/23, and Alcoa Corporation will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.10 on 11/17/23. As a percentage of OHI's recent stock price of $33.81, this dividend works out to approximately 1.98%, so look for shares of Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc. to trade 1.98% lower — all else being equal — when OHI shares open for trading on 10/30/23. Similarly, investors should look for TXN to open 0.90% lower in price and for AA to open 0.42% lower, all else being equal.

Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc. (Symbol: OHI):
Texas Instruments Inc. (Symbol: TXN):
Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA):
In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 7.93% for Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc., 3.61% for Texas Instruments Inc., and 1.66% for Alcoa Corporation.
In Thursday trading, Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc. shares are currently up about 0.7%, Texas Instruments Inc. shares are up about 1.5%, and Alcoa Corporation shares are up about 0.8% on the day.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $23.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $21.69 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $23.64/share today.
Because the $23.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.70% return on the cash commitment, or 48.30% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $23.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $24.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.51. If an investor was to purchase shares of AA stock at the current price level of $23.64/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $24.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.91% if the stock gets called away at the December 8th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $24.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $24.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.39% boost of extra return to the investor, or 54.17% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $23.64) to be 53%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

LONDON, Nov 7 (Reuters) - European Union (EU) energy ministers last month struck a dea","By Andy Home
LONDON, Nov 7 (Reuters) - European Union (EU) energy ministers last month struck a deal to reform the bloc's power market.
The proposed changes to the EU's ""electricity market design"" are a response to the spike in European power prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
They will, according to Spain's Energy Minister Teresa Ribera, mean that ""consumers across the EU will be able to benefit from much more stable prices of energy, less dependency on the price of fossil fuels and better protection from future crises"".
But will it be enough to save Europe's struggling industrial metals production sector?
The brutal reality is that half of the region's primary aluminium and zinc capacity and almost a third of its silicon capacity is currently offline due to high power prices.
The immediate impact comes with potential future impact as well.
Producers are reluctant to invest in the new metals capacity needed to achieve Europe's self-sufficiency goals because they can't model power prices over the time-frame to build a new mine or smelter.
""We need bold action to get out of a dead-end street,"" was the stark warning from Bernard Respaut, head of the European Copper Institute (ECI), speaking at a debate on Europe's power crisis jointly hosted with industry association Eurometaux.
LIGHT-TOUCH REFORM
European power prices have fallen a long way from their 2022 peaks, when the region was still reeling from the reduction in Russian gas supplies.
However, they are by no means back to levels trading before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and that isn't going to change any time soon.
Wholesale pricing will continue to be determined on a pay-as-clear model, where bidding goes from the cheapest to the most expensive source, which tends to be gas. It's just that it's now LNG rather than Russian gas that sets the price.
EU member states were deeply split on proposals for more fundamental reform of Europe's power market to allow for a complete break of the gas-power price linkage.
The hard-won compromise keeps the existing market mechanism, which its supporters claim is more efficient than other models in a liberalised electricity market.
Rather, the focus will be on longer-term price stabilisers such as power purchase agreements (PPA) between generators and users and two-way contracts for difference (CFD) for investment in new green generation.
THE PPA PROBLEM
U.S. aluminium producer Alcoa AA.N is a poster child for Europe's PPA model, using it to help secure the long-term future of its San Ciprian smelter in Spain.
The company has PPAs with local power suppliers Endesa ELE.MC and Greenalia covering around 75% of the smelter's base load power when it returns from care and maintenance next year.
Alcoa has the advantage of being in Spain, which has been aggressively building out renewable energy capacity and has Europe's most developed PPA market.
The country is Europe's third highest renewable energy generator, much of it solar, and has by far the highest PPA contract capacity at a current 4.2 gigawatts, according to the European Commission. (""The development of renewable energy in the electricity market"", June 2023).
Others are not so fortunate.
""We can't buy a PPA because it's not available on the market,"" Mats Gustavsson, head of energy at Swedish base metals producer Boliden BOL.ST, told the Eurometaux meeting.
With limited forward liquidity in the company's local Nordpool power market, ""no-one's willing to take the risk on a fixed-term PPA"", he said.
Even if the local market structure allows for PPAs, many smaller companies struggle to pass the credit tests needed to sign what can be as long as a 10-year contract.
Moreover, many power suppliers will only offer PPAs on a pay-as-produced basis rather than the base-load structure that metal producers would prefer.
The EU reform package is intended to iron out some of these problems by, for example, mandating member states to ensure guarantee schemes for smaller companies looking to enter PPAs.
But it offers neither short-term relief for Europe's many mothballed production facilities nor the levels of certainty needed to build the next generation of mines and processing plants.
STRATEGIC DIALOGUE
Europe's focus on the longer-term solution, pivoting towards cheaper renewable energy, leaves untouched the immediate problem of tying spot power pricing to a volatile gas market.
The bloc's power prices have historically been twice those of the U.S., but are now three or four times higher.
Metals producers are not only having to adjust to currently high electricity costs, but face even higher costs as they seek their own pathway to net zero.
The danger is that the cost of going green ""is going to kill us"", Gustavsson said. Boliden, it's worth noting, has just shuttered its Tara zinc-lead mine in Ireland at least partly due to high energy costs.
The answer, according to the ECI's Respaut, is to take a more comprehensive approach to Europe's industrial base and connect the disparate dots of critical metals production, renewable energy and power pricing.
Europe has to decide which strategic sectors it wants to keep and what it needs to do to help them not just survive but thrive.
And it needs to do so sooner rather than later.
As Respaut concluded: ""We need to get to action, because time is running.""

2023-11-10,"Investors in Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) saw new options become available this week, for the Janu","Investors in Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) saw new options become available this week, for the January 2026 expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 798 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AA options chain for the new January 2026 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $22.50 strike price has a current bid of $4.80. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $22.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $17.70 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $24.74/share today.
Because the $22.50 strike represents an approximate 9% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 72%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 21.33% return on the cash commitment, or 9.76% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $22.50 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $30.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.95. If an investor was to purchase shares of AA stock at the current price level of $24.74/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $30.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 45.31% if the stock gets called away at the January 2026 expiration (before broker commissions).

Below is a chart showing AA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $30.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $30.00 strike represents an approximate 21% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

2023-11-17,"Updates with data on Russian aluminium imports in paragraphs 5-6
LONDON/BRUSSELS, Nov 17 (Reuters) ","Updates with data on Russian aluminium imports in paragraphs 5-6
LONDON/BRUSSELS, Nov 17 (Reuters) - The European Union should impose broader import bans on Russian aluminium, industry group European Aluminium said on Friday, arguing that the current proposal to ban certain products would have only a limited impact.
EU members are currently debating a European Commission proposal for a 12th package of sanctions set to include import bans for diamonds and liquefied propane and measures designed to tighten implementation of a price cap on Russian oil.
It also includes bans on aluminium wires, tubes and pipes, but these only make up 12% of EU aluminium imports from Russia, European Aluminium said in a statement.
""We strongly encourage the European Union to accelerate its efforts and broaden their scope to cover all major product categories,"" said Director General Paul Voss.
EU industry has already started to phase out Russian aluminium, with January-August imports down by a third from the same period in 2022, based on European Aluminium data. For ingots, Russia represented 9% of all EU imports, compared with 25% in previous years.
In the first nine months of this year, EU imported almost 500,000 metric tons of Russian aluminium and aluminium products worth 1.26 billion euros ($1.37 billion), according to Eurostat data. For 2022, imports were worth 2.84 billion euros.
In July, the group sent a letter to members saying it had discussed the possibility of ""actively calling for EU sanctions on Russian aluminium"", but not on Russian major producer Rusal RUAL.MM.
While substituting other supply for Russian ingots would be feasible in Europe, the wide global spread of Rusal's operations makes sanctions on that company more problematic, July's memorandum said.
Friday's statement did not mention Rusal, which produced 4 million metric tons of primary aluminium last year, about 6% of global supply.
European Aluminium members include refiners, smelters, manufacturers of semi-finished products and recyclers, including top producers Hydro NHY.OL, Alcoa AA.N and Rio Tinto RIO.L.

2023-11-20,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have comp","Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the SPDR S&P 400 Mid Cap Value ETF (Symbol: MDYV), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $75.92 per unit.
With MDYV trading at a recent price near $66.15 per unit, that means that analysts see 14.76% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of MDYV's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA), Greif Inc (Symbol: GEF), and Gentex Corp. (Symbol: GNTX). Although AA has traded at a recent price of $26.22/share, the average analyst target is 16.90% higher at $30.65/share. Similarly, GEF has 16.60% upside from the recent share price of $68.61 if the average analyst target price of $80.00/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting GNTX to reach a target price of $35.67/share, which is 15.42% above the recent price of $30.90. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of AA, GEF, and GNTX:
Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
SPDR S&P 400 Mid Cap Value ETF MDYV $66.15 $75.92 14.76%
Alcoa Corporation AA $26.22 $30.65 16.90%
Greif Inc GEF $68.61 $80.00 16.60%
Gentex Corp. GNTX $30.90 $35.67 15.42%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.
